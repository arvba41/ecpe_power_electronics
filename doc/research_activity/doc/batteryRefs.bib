The paper examines the primary degradation processes in cycled cells, then proceeds to the challenges associated with controlling these processes. One key challenge is the multiplicity of complex phenomena contributing to battery aging, and the failure of most empirical battery health models to account for this multiplicity. This creates a need for identifying how batteries fail, and developing control-oriented fundamental models of their failure: a task that requires tight integration of experimental characterization techniques, system identiﬁcation, and electrochemistry-based battery modeling and simulation. The paper provides an overview of battery degradation mechanisms and reactions, and the various methods used to characterize these reactions. We also highlight the battery control strategies currently in use, and the potential for long-term battery health improvements using model-based degradation control.},

This paper presents an electrochemistry-based impedance model for lithium-ion batteries to better understand the relationship between battery internal dynamics and external measurement. The proposed impedance model is a modiﬁed single particle model which balances between simplicity and accuracy. The model includes electrochemical impedance due to charge-transfer reaction, diffusion dynamics in the electrodes, effects of ion concentration, capacitance dispersion in the double layer, and anode insulating ﬁlm growth, etc. The impedance tests for model validation were performed on two lithium-ion cells at ambient temperature and at different SOC levels. A particle swarm optimization method is employed to identify model parameters. The model accuracy under different conditions is compared with that of conventional Randles model and the parameter variations at different stage of the aging process are studied.},

The impedance variation of battery according to the degradation over the life is measured and used for evaluating the State-of-Health (SOH) of the battery. The voltage perturbation and the current response of the battery are measured by the digital lock-in amplifier embedded in the digital signal processor (DSP) in order to calculate the impedance of the battery. The parameters of the equivalent circuit model for the lead-acid battery are extracted by using the complex non-linear least square method and compared to the reference values to estimate the SOH of the battery.

In addition, it has a profound impact on performance, cost and reliability of the target vehicle. The work presented in this paper concerns automotive type NMC/graphite Li-ion battery cells aged under realistic and accelerated conditions, analyzed using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and with the implementation of an electric equivalent circuit model. Two cycle life tests were performed at +22°C and +45°C surrounding temperature, with reference performance tests performed at ±0°C, +22°C and +45°C. The duty cycle applied is derived from speed samples of real-world city driving characteristics for electric passenger cars with fast charging at 2C-rate. Results show that despite a significant decrease in capacity, a decrease in charge transfer resistance can be observed during the first stages of aging which may be correlated to an increased double layer capacitance. Also, an increase in peak power at low temperatures is observed.},

The ECs are evaluated in terms of model accuracy and parameterization time for the systematic assignment of an equivalent circuit to application fields. For this purpose, impedance spectra were measured using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy at different states of charge, health and temperatures. Then the parameters of the EC were extracted using the least-squares method and the Levenberg–Marquardt algorithm. After comparing the simulated to the measured impedance spectrum, a review and assignment of equivalent circuits for potential applications is given. Simple equivalent circuits with a series resistor and a maximum of two resistance–capacitance (RC) elements are ideal for simulations with lower dynamics. Equivalent circuits with up to five RC elements or even a constant-phase element (CPE) are promising for simulating highly dynamic processes. By using RCPE elements the impedance spectrum can be modeled with the highest accuracy, which is why this type of model should be used for diagnostic purposes.},

Identiﬁability is addressed both in principle and in practice. The approach begins by grouping parameters and partially non-dimensionalising the SPM to determine the maximum expected degrees of freedom in the problem. We discover that, excluding open circuit voltage, there are only six independent parameters. We then examine the structural identiﬁability by considering whether the transfer function of the linearised SPM is unique. It is found that the model is unique provided that the electrode open circuit voltage functions have a known non-zero gradient, the parameters are ordered, and the electrode kinetics are lumped into a single charge transfer resistance parameter. We then demonstrate the practical estimation of model parameters from measured frequency-domain experimental electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) data, and show additionally that the parametrised model provides good predictive capabilities in the time domain, exhibiting a maximum voltage error of 20 mV between model and experiment over a 10 minute dynamic discharge.},

It predicts the cell voltage at each operating point by calculating the total overvoltage from the individual contributions of (i) the ohmic loss η0, (ii) the charge transfer loss of the cathode ηCT,C, (iii) the charge transfer loss and the solid electrolyte interface loss of the anode ηSEI/CT,A, and (iv) the solid state and electrolyte diﬀusion loss ηDiﬀ,A/C/E. This approach is based on a physically meaningful equivalent circuit model, which is parametrized by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and time domain measurements, covering a wide frequency range from MHz to μHz. The model is exemplarily parametrized to a commercial, high-power 350 mAh graphite/LiNiCoAlO2-LiCoO2 pouch cell and validated by continuous discharge and charge curves at varying temperature. For the ﬁrst time, the physical background of the model allows the operator to draw conclusions about the performance-limiting factor at various operating conditions. Not only can the model help to choose application-optimized cell characteristics, but it can also support the battery management system when taking corrective actions during operation.},

The FESEM and TEM results shows the porosity pattern depends on the reduction atmosphere.

The EIS analysis shows that the continuous mobility of electrons interior of SiC is too higher than the Li+ solvated sheath due to interstitial carbon atom in the silicon carbide composite, whilst, the formation of a thicken Li+ solvated sheath on the surface of macro pores causes an electrode blocking and eventually the ﬁnite length diffusion. The calculation of A×C indicates an irregularity in concentration of Li+ ions at different potentials to conﬁrm the alloying mechanism for Li+ ion diffusivity at the active surface site in silicon at fresh electrolyte condition against depletion in the SEI layer as a second source of Lithium after 10 months aging.},

The test procedure evaluated the advantage of using a supercapacitor at a 2 F:1 Ah ratio with the battery types at various states of charge (SoC). The results showed that about 7\% of extra charge was achieved over a 5-s test time for a Li-ion hybrid system at 20\% SoC, whereas at the 80\% SoC the additional capacity was approximately 16\%. While for the VRLA battery hybrid system, an additional charge of up to 20\% was achieved when the battery was at 80\% SoC, with little or no beneﬁt at the 20\% SoC. The advantage of the supercapacitor in parallel with a VRLA battery was noticeable on its discharge ability, where signiﬁcant extra capacity was achieved for short periods of time for a battery at the 60\% and 40\% SoC when compared to the Li-ion hybrid system.

	abstract = {Fast charge of Li-ion cells is one of the main challenges in automotive battery application. As a particular problem at low temperatures and high charging rates, lithium deposits as metal on the anode surface (so-called lithium plating) instead of intercalation. Electrochemical models help to understand internal processes and predict aging effects, which ﬁnally lead to optimized charging strategies. In this work, a 1D þ 1D (pseudo-2D) electrochemical model is developed, applied over a wide range of temperature (T ¼ À25  C to 40  C) and current (I ¼ 0.1 C to 6 C), and coupled with a 0D thermal model. The model is parameterized with measurement data in frequency domain using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and validated with time-domain data. In experiments cells are charged under different operating conditions. Capacity fade is measured after a signiﬁcant number of cycles and compared to the simulated anode potential. A qualitative correlation is found between the degradation in experiment and the anode potential dropping below 0 V vs. Li/Liþ at the separator-anode boundary in the simulation. Furthermore a semi-quantitative expression for degradation is introduced. The transformation of the model into an on-board applicable form is presented in the companion contribution (part II).},

The model describes the charging process of a lithium-ion cell and possibly occurring degradation effects in a large temperature range and is presented in Part I of this contribution. The model-reduction process is explained in detail, and the gained model is compared to the original electrochemical model showing a very high approximation quality. This reduced model offers a very low computation complexity and is therefore suitable for the implementation in a battery management system (BMS). Based on this model, an advanced charging strategy is presented and evaluated for possible reductions in charging times especially at low temperatures.},

In a previous publication, we described a single-point impedance diagnostic method for detecting damage in single prismatic lithium polymer rechargeable cells subjected to overcharge abuse. We now determine whether the single-point impedance diagnostic method is applicable to 4S battery packs. At 316 Hz, commercial 18650 LiCoO2 cells are determined to have the least change in impedance response when cycled between 3.0 and 4.2 V, for states-of-charge (SOC) of 0e100\%. The impedance response of single cells at 316 Hz changes dramatically during overcharge (SOC ¼ 125\%), presumably due to change in their solid electrolyte interface (SEI) layers at the electrodes. When a single cell is purposely subjected to such overcharge abuse and then integrated into a 4S pack with 3 other healthy cells, the impedance response of the 4S pack at 316 Hz also changes, despite variances in the impedance response of each of the 3 healthy cells. The results suggest that this single-point impedance method could serve as a diagnostic in an all-inclusive battery management system to identify overcharge abuse of single cells without individual cell monitoring.},

Besides modelling the performance behavior of Lithium-ion batteries, it has become of huge interest to accurately diagnose their state-of-health (SOH). At present, Lithium-ion batteries are diagnosed by performing capacity or resistance (current pulse) measurements; however, in the majority of the cases, these measurements are time consuming and result in changing the state of the battery as well. This paper investigates the use of the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) technique for SOH diagnosis of Lithium-ion battery cells, instead of using the aforementioned techniques, since this new method allows for online and direct measurement of the battery cell response in any working point. For the investigation, a 2.5 Ah Lithium-ion battery cell based on lithium iron phosphate and graphite (LiFePO4/C), as active material, was used. The obtained results at different battery SOH levels have been analyzed in detail and are suggesting that the EIS technique represents a promising tool for diagnosis the lithium-ion battery cells’ SOH; meaningful results regarding the pulse power capability decrease of the tested Li-ion battery cells were obtained by applying the EIS technique.},

Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is a well-established method for cell characterization and analyzing electrochemical processes. In order to integrate this method into long-term aging studies with real driving currents, new test equipment is mandatory. The presented test equipment meets the demands for high current, wide bandwidth and precise measurement. This allows the cells to be cycled and characterized without interruption for changing the test device. The characterization procedures must be of short duration and have a minimum charge-throughput for negligible inﬂuence on the aging effect. This work presents new methods in the time and the frequency domain for obtaining the impedance spectrum which allow a ﬂexible tradeoff between measurement performance, time consumption and charge-throughput. In addition to sinusoidal waveforms, rectangular, Gaussian and sin(x)/x pulses are applied for EIS. The performance of the different methods is discussed. Finally, the time domain analysis is applied with real driving currents which provides impedance spectra for state of charge estimation considering aging effects in the car.},

	abstract = {Lithium-ion batteries are at the forefront of energy storage technology due to its high energy density and durability; they are however expensive and must be operated within certain limits to prevent damaging them. Thus, there is a need for improved condition monitoring to increase its life expectancy and performance. In this work, Electrochemical Impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is implemented using a bi-directional DC-DC converter to characterize the lithium-ion battery under near realtime conditions. EIS is a widely used technique for characterizing electrochemical cells, however, due to long procedural time involved, it is limited to offline (laboratory) testing. This paper investigates several types of impedance spectroscopy (IS) techniques that can be performed while a battery is connected to a load, to characterize the lithium-ion battery and hence determine and monitor its State of Health (SoH) and State of Charge (SoC). The main contribution of this work is the implementation of a multi-sine broadband impedance spectroscopy (BIS) technique in a switching converter to reduce measurement time and thus enable near real-time IS measurement. The proposed technique is carried out using the associated battery converter without additional components incorporated into the converter. Results obtained show that the BIS implemented on the switching converter is effective at characterizing the battery’s impedance spectrum as compared to the conventional EIS.},

This is an important aspect because, measuring the impedance in a wide frequency range, it is possible to investigate on the modifications of the internal electrochemical cell process and evaluating its State of Health (SOH), that it is an important parameter for the automotive applications. The first part of the paper explains the concept of Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) and how Li-ion batteries can be represented through electrochemical or empirical models. EIS test consists of the excitation of the battery, or cell, with a sinusoidal current signal, and then measuring the cell voltage, while the frequency response of the system is computed. Then the paper describes a procedure to test the cell and extract the parameters necessary for the model, in particular, the dependence between the parameters of the model and the State of Charge (SOC). Finally the paper shows how the internal impedance of a Li-ion battery is a dynamic parameter that depends on different factors and illustrate how the EIS can be used to obtain an impedance model.},

An ECM is constructed in this paper to characterize the ageing behavior of battery by fitting ECM to experimentally measured EIS data within the frequency range from 0.01 Hz to 7.928 kHz. The experimentally measured EIS and SOH data are obtained from an accelerated ageing experiment of lithium-ion battery conducted in the laboratory. The comparison between the EIS data generated from the constructed ECM and experimentally measured EIS data validates the constructed ECM. The variations of the parameters of the ECM as a function of the changes in the SOH of the battery showed that as the battery’s health deteriorates overtime, the value of series resistor of the ECM increases and the values of the capacitance components of CPE of the ECM decrease. The presented model and its results can provide a way to estimate or co-estimate the SOH of the battery.},

In the past decades, the impedance is frequently reported as a powerful tool used in the ﬁeld of lithium-ion battery state estimation and diagnosis. This paper reviews more than 170 papers and organizes the related research according to three themes of impedance modeling, acquisition, and application under the premise of electric vehicle implementation. The strength and weaknesses of the research in each theme are discussed. Based on the research, the possibility and the value of impedance in onboard battery management are revealed. However, challenges are still faced due to the cost limitations, the complex vehicular conditions, and the time-varying battery states. The unsolved issues are summarized in the conclusion. To realize a more smart battery management system with the impedance, more signiﬁcant work is still needed.},

A technique known as Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) provides a non-destructive way of measuring battery impedance, offering detailed insight into the battery state of operation. Several challenges must be solved in to utilize EIS as part of the BMS, including the deﬁning of operating conditions at which to perform the sensitive EIS measurement. In laboratory conditions, several hours of rest are used to ensure a stable response of the battery, but such rest times are impractical for BMS applications. This paper proposes a methodology combining drift compensation and a Voigt-circuit used as a ﬁlter to obtain valid EIS data with short rest times under different operating conditions. Extensive tests were conducted on lithium nickel manganese cobalt (NMC) batteries to evaluate the methodology and show how the different operating conditions impact the rest time required for valid EIS measurement. The results show that rest times between 5 and 30 minutes can be used to obtain useful EIS data for a wide range of operating conditions.},

	abstract = {Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) are widely used in electric vehicles due to its high energy density and low pollution. As the key monitoring parameters of battery management system (BMS), accurate estimation of the state of charge (SOC) and state of health (SOH) can promote the utilization rate of battery, which is of great significance to ensure the safe use of LIBs. In this paper, a novel dual Kalman filter method is proposed to achieve simultaneous SOC and SOH estimation. This paper improves the estimation accuracy of SOC and SOH from the following four aspects. Firstly, the widely used equivalent circuit model is established as the battery model in this paper, and the forgetting factor recursive least squares (FFRLS) method is applied to identify the model parameters. Secondly, two kinds of single-variable battery states are established to analyze the influence of OCV-SOC curve and battery capacity on SOC estimation. Based on this, an error model is proposed combined with Kalman filter to achieve better estimation results of SOC and SOH. Besides, to promote the accuracy of SOC estimation, based on the error innovation sequence (EIS) and residual innovation sequence (RIS), the improved dual adaptive extended Kalman filter (IDAEKF) algorithm based on dynamic window is proposed. Finally, the superiority of the proposed model is verified under different cycles. Experimental results show that the estimation error of SOC and SOH is controlled within 1\%.},

Influenced by multiple factors, SOH is an aging path-dependent parameter, which challenges its accurate estimation and prediction. Numerous methods have been proposed for lithium-ion batteries SOH di­ agnostics and prognostics, but there is little discussion on how to characterize SOH. In this paper, we first review the existing characteristic parameters in defining battery SOH at cell-level and pack-level, and then propose some suggestions for SOH definitions. The impact of external influencing factors on battery degradation is introduced to lay a foundation for SOH estimation. SOH estimation methods are categorized by the parameters used to define SOH, i.e. capacity, impedance and aging-mechanism parameters. We discuss the goals of SOH monitoring and summarize its applications from short- and long-term perspectives accordingly. Finally, the challenges and future trends of battery SOH diagnostics and prognostics are thoroughly analyzed and discussed, in order to provide a comprehensive understanding for researchers and technologists.},

	abstract = {This paper presents an adaptive state-of-health (SOH) estimation method that utilizes artificial neural network (ANN) and online AC complex impedance. The zero crossing frequency of battery impedance phase can reflect the aging status of battery based on the observation from the aging data. However, the relationship between the zero crossing frequency and SOH is nonlinear. In order to model this nonlinear relationship for SOH prediction, ANN as a powerful nonlinear fitting tool or method is explored in this paper in order to characterize this relationship. The designed ANN can update its parameters based on the feedback data from the operation of the system. This feature makes the proposed method be able to adapt to the changes in the operation conditions and aging conditions of the battery, which enables better SOH prediction accuracy compared with the static SOH model methods when the operation conditions or battery conditions are different from the ones that the static SOH models are derived from. The proposed SOH estimation method also allows for fast prediction compared with the conventional capacity fading methods. This is mainly because the parameter used for SOH prediction, i.e. battery impedance phase, can be obtained within a short time during the online operation of the system. A preliminary experimental prototype is built in the laboratory to verify the proposed method.},

The capacity degradation model is developed recently based on battery capacity test data. An empirical model for internal resistance growth is also developed based on electrochemical-impedance spectroscopy (EIS) test data. The obtained models are used in a particle ﬁltering (PF) framework for making end-of-lifetime (EOL) predictions at various phases of its lifecycle. Further, the above two models were fused together to obtain a new degradation model for RUL estimation. It has been observed that the fused degradation model has improved the standard deviation of prediction as compared to the individual degradation models by maintaining satisfactory prediction accuracy. The effect of parameter variations on the performance of the PF algorithm has also been studied. Finally, the predictions are validated with experimental data. From the results it can be observed that with the availability of longer volume of data, the prediction accuracy gradually improves.

In this context, LIBs at diﬀerent aging states using various active materials (NMC/C, NMC/LTO, LFP/C) are investigated.

	abstract = {Impedance and open circuit voltage (OCV) parameter identiﬁcation is the key technology for state of health (SOH) diagnosis of lithium ion battery (LIB) in an equivalent circuit model (ECM). The current identiﬁcation methods of impedance and OCV parameter are time consuming, destructive, non-real-time and costly. It is usually difﬁcult to identify each component from the overall impedance parameter using aforesaid impedance identiﬁcation methods, which severely affects the identiﬁcation precision of impedance parameter. Furthermore, fast OCV identiﬁcation is another difﬁcult issue to be resolved. In this paper, a new real-time and nondestructive method is developed to identify dynamic impedance parameter for SOH diagnosis ECM (SDEM) of LIB. This method can identify ohmic impedance and charge transfer impedance from internal impedance and realize the transformation of Warburg diffusion impedance from frequency domain to time domain. Fast determination method of OCV is proposed based on the short-time and low current pulse to realize real-time measurement and identiﬁcation of the OCV. Dynamic update of the all parameters is conducted based on least squares method (LSM). SDEM with new developed impedance and OCV parameter identiﬁcation method is validated with high accuracy.},

Concepts of regional capacity and regional voltage are introduced to develop an SoH model against experimental cycling data from four types of batteries. In the obtained models, SoH is a simple linear function of the regional capacity, and the R-square of linear ﬁtting is up to 0.948 for all the considered batteries with properly selected regional voltage. The proposed method without using characteristic parameters directly from incremental capacity curves is insensitive to noise and ﬁltering algorithms, and is eﬀective for common current rates, where rates of up to 1C have been demonstrated. Then, a model-based SoH estimator is designed and shown to be capable of closely matching battery's aging data from NASA, with the error less than 2.5\%. Furthermore, such a small scale of error is achieved in the absent of state of charge and impedance which are often used for SOH estimation in available methods.},

In this paper, a novel integrated approach based on a mixture of Gaussian process (MGP) model and particle ﬁltering (PF) is presented for lithium-ion battery SOH estimation under uncertain conditions. Instead of directly assuming a certain state space model for capacity degradation, in this paper, the distribution of the degradation process is learnt from the inputs based on the available capacity monitoring data. To capture the time-varying degradation behavior, the proposed method fuses the training data from different battery conditions as the multiple inputs for the distribution learning using the MGP model. Then, a recursive updating of the distribution parameters is conducted. By exploiting the distribution information of the degradation model parameters, the PF can be implemented to predict the battery SOH. Experiments and comparison analysis are provided to demonstrate the efﬁciency of the proposed approach.},

This can be achieved by monitoring the increase of the internal resistance of the battery cells over the whole lifetime of the battery. In this paper, a method to estimate state of health (SoH) is presented through the established linear relationship between ohmic internal resistance and capacity fade. Firstly, the Thevenin model and the recursive least squares (RLS) algorithm are applied to simulate battery dynamic characteristics and identify model parameters, respectively. Secondly, based on the established linear relationship between ohmic internal resistance and capacity fade, both ohmic internal resistances at the start and the end of the battery’s lifetime are estimated by only two random discharge cycles at diﬀerent aging stages. Finally, an online SoH estimator is formulated and applied to estimate the SoH of a battery’s remaining cycles. In addition, a series of experiments were carried out based on dynamic loading to verify the proposed method. The SoH estimates indicate that the evaluated maximum SoH errors are within ± 4\%. The proposed SoH estimation method is consistent with the measurement data of the battery and shows good results with very low computational eﬀort.},

These parameters can reﬂect the battery aging phenomenon from diﬀerent angles. The grey relational analysis method is applied to analyze the relational grade between selected features and SOH. On the other hand, some adjustments are made in the proposed GPR model. Covariance function design and the similarity measurement of input variables are modiﬁed so as to improve the SOH estimate accuracy and adapt to the case of multidimensional input. Several aging data from NASA data repository are used for demonstrating the estimation eﬀect by the proposed method. Results show that the proposed method has high SOH estimation accuracy.

For online battery prognostics, it is critical to make timely and accurate response to SOH. The loss of rated capacity of a battery is usually used to determine the battery SOH, whereas the measurement of the capacity of an operating battery is quite challenging. Normally, the rated capacity fading largely relies on laboratory measurements and oﬄine analysis. In this paper, two real-time measurable health indicators (HI) - one is the time interval of an equal charging voltage diﬀerence (TIECVD), and the other is the time interval of an equal discharging voltage diﬀerence (TIEDVD) - are extracted. A novel method which combines feature vector selection (FVS) with SVR is utilized to model the relationship between these two HIs and capacity, then the online capacity can be evaluated, more accurate prognostics of SOH and remaining useful life (RUL) can be made. Besides, compared to standard SVR, the proposed method takes FVS to cut down the training data size, which improves the eﬃciency of model training and prediction. In the end, two datasets demonstrated this approach performs both well in accuracy and eﬃciency.},

	abstract = {Due to increasing concerns about global warming, greenhouse gas emissions, and the depletion of fossil fuels, the electric vehicles (EVs) receive massive popularity due to their performances and eﬃciencies in recent decades. EVs have already been widely accepted in the automotive industries considering the most promising replacements in reducing CO2 emissions and global environmental issues. Lithium-ion batteries have attained huge attention in EVs application due to their lucrative features such as lightweight, fast charging, high energy density, low self-discharge and long lifespan. This paper comprehensively reviews the lithium-ion battery state of charge (SOC) estimation and its management system towards the sustainable future EV applications. The signiﬁcance of battery management system (BMS) employing lithium-ion batteries is presented, which can guarantee a reliable and safe operation and assess the battery SOC. The review identiﬁes that the SOC is a crucial parameter as it signiﬁes the remaining available energy in a battery that provides an idea about charging/discharging strategies and protect the battery from overcharging/over discharging. It is also observed that the SOC of the existing lithium-ion batteries have a good contribution to run the EVs safely and eﬃciently with their charging/discharging capabilities. However, they still have some challenges due to their complex electro-chemical reactions, performance degradation and lack of accuracy towards the enhancement of battery performance and life. The classiﬁcation of the estimation methodologies to estimate SOC focusing with the estimation model/algorithm, beneﬁts, drawbacks and estimation error are extensively reviewed. The review highlights many factors and challenges with possible recommendations for the development of BMS and estimation of SOC in next-generation EV applications. All the highlighted insights of this review will widen the increasing eﬀorts towards the development of the advanced SOC estimation method and energy management system of lithium-ion battery for the future high-tech EV applications.},

The ageing phenomena are highly complicated to characterize due to the factors cross-dependence. This paper reviews various aspects of recent research and developments, from different ﬁelds, on lithium-ion battery ageing mechanisms and estimations. In this paper is presented a summary of techniques, models and algorithms used for battery ageing estimation (SOH, RUL), going from a detailed electrochemical approach to statistical methods based on data. In order to present the accuracy of currently used methods, their respective characteristics are discussed. Remaining challenges are deeply detailed, along with a discussion about the ideal method resulting from existing methods.},

	abstract = {State of Health (SOH) estimation of lithium ion batteries is critical for Battery Management Systems (BMSs) in Electric Vehicles (EVs). Many estimation techniques utilize a battery model; however, the model must have high accuracy and high computational eﬃciency. Conventional electrochemical full-order models can accurately capture battery states, but they are too complex and computationally expensive to be used in a BMS. A Single Particle (SP) model is a good alternative that addresses this issue; however, existing SP models do not consider degradation physics. In this work, an SP-based degradation model is developed by including Solid Electrolyte Interface (SEI) layer formation, coupled with crack propagation due to the stress generated by the volume expansion of the particles in the active materials. A model of lithium ion loss from SEI layer formation is integrated with an advanced SP model that includes electrolytic physics. This low-order model quickly predicts capacity fade and voltage proﬁle changes as a function of cycle number and temperature with high accuracy, allowing for the use of online estimation techniques. Lithium ion loss due to SEI layer formation, increase in battery resistance, and changes in the electrodes' open circuit potential operating windows are examined to account for capacity fade and power loss. In addition to the low-order implementation to facilitate on-line estimation, the model proposed in this paper provides quantitative information regarding SEI layer formation and crack propagation, as well as the resulting battery capacity fade and power dissipation, which are essential for SOH estimation in a BMS.},

Due to the ambiguous mechanism and sensitivity to the objective factors of lithium-ion batteries, it is difﬁcult to recognize the degradation state and monitor the SoH of a battery. A recognition method for the degradation state to estimate the remaining capacity online has been presented. First, through the analysis of the results of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) tests at different SoHs, the degradation level can be detected by the EIS measurement. Second, according to the fractional order theory, an online parameter identiﬁcation approach with the fractional order impedance model has been proposed for the degradation analysis. Third, the correlation between variation of parameters and degradation level is discussed and the SEI (Solid Electrolyte Interphase) resistance is extracted to predict the remaining capacity by selecting an appropriate ﬁtting function. Finally, the effectiveness of the presented method is validated by the test data, and the estimation error of the remaining capacity can be guaranteed within 3\%.},

In this paper, we propose a uniﬁed OCV model that can be applied for both SOC estimation and SOH monitoring. Improvements in SOC estimation using the new model compared to other existing models are demonstrated. Moreover, it is shown that the proposed OCV model can be used to perform battery SOH monitoring as it effectively captures aging information based on incremental capacity analysis (ICA). Parametric analysis and model complexity reduction are also addressed.

However, a battery model initialized with static parameters which are identiﬁed in ideal laboratory conditions will not be able to get an accurate estimation in various actual applications. Besides, it is timeconsuming and complex in implement. To solve the above problem, a new battery states estimation method is proposed. Firstly, an adaptive battery model is proposed according to a new online parameter estimation algorithm. Based on it, the parameter adaptive sliding mode observer for state of charge is proposed. Thus, the state of charge systematic error led from various work environments could be effectively reduced. The parameter adaptive sliding mode observer for state of health is proposed by tracing the derivative of open circuit voltage estimated online. As the reference open circuit voltage is estimated based on measurable inputs and outputs, rather than conventional observer with an assumed constant capacity. The estimated battery capacity could converge to the actual value while the error of battery open circuit voltage converges to zero. The proposed method is veriﬁed through the urban dynamometer driving schedule driving cycle. The results indicate that:1) parameters estimated online are accurate, 2) the absolute error of state of charge is less than 2\%, 3) the estimated lithium-ion battery capacity could converge to the actual value with small capacity error.},

The features in the degradation process of a battery are conveniently measured by a group of current pulses, which last only few seconds. The proposed evolutionary framework selects the most eﬃcient combination of the short-term features from the current pulse test, and guarantees an optimal training process simultaneously. A hybrid encoding technology is applied to mix the feature extraction and the parameters of support vector regression in one chromosome. With the beneﬁt of the proposed evolutionary framework, the battery state of health is estimated by using support vector regression and genetic algorithm in a more eﬃcient way.

Besides, the state-of-charge estimation error is less than 3\% under various common perturbations and parameter uncertainties, including the uncertainty of battery capacity, the Gaussian white noise and the biases of the sensors, which proves the robustness of the estimator. Generally, the drivers prefer to charge the electric vehicles after every driving. In other words, the lithium-ion batteries are likely to be charged or discharged from any state-of-charge and polarization state. In order to simulate this usage habit, several data segments are picked out from original data for state-of-charge estimation. Experiment results show that the state-of-charge estimation error reaches and remains within 3\% rapidly under both the constant current constant voltage charging conditions and the dynamic discharging conditions.

Battery degradation dynamics are chemistry dependent and change signiﬁcantly for newer chemistries. Moreover, characterizing these degradation dynamics requires time-consuming and expensive laboratory testing. Together, these facts motivate the following question: is it possible to use battery current and voltage measurements to learn battery degradation behavior in a datacenter where numerous distributed batteries are being used for demand response? If so, what are the beneﬁts and challenges associated with such learning? The goal of this paper is to provide preliminary answers to these questions building on earlier work by authors on health-conscious stochastic battery control.

	abstract = {Model-based observers appeal to both research and industry utilization due to the high accuracy and robustness. To further improve the robustness to dynamic work conditions and battery ageing, the online model identiﬁcation is integrated to the state estimation, giving rise to the co-estimation methods. This paper systematically compares three types of co-estimation methods for the online state of charge of lithium-ion battery. This ﬁrst method is dual extended Kalman ﬁlter which uses two parallel ﬁlters for co-estimation. The second method is a typical data-model fusion method which uses recursive least squares for model identiﬁcation and extended Kalman ﬁlter for state estimation. Meanwhile, a noise compensating method based on recursive total least squares and Rayleigh quotient minimization is exploited for online model identiﬁcation, which is further designed in conjunction with the extended Kalman ﬁlter to estimate the state of charge. Simulation and experimental studies are carried out to compare the performances of three methods in terms of the accuracy, convergence property, and noise immunity. The computing cost and tuning eﬀort are further discussed to give insights to the application prospective of diﬀerent methods.},

	abstract = {Degradation in lithium ion (Li-ion) battery cells is the result of a complex interplay of a host of different physical and chemical mechanisms. The measurable, physical effects of these degradation mechanisms on the cell can be summarised in terms of three degradation modes, namely loss of lithium inventory, loss of active positive electrode material and loss of active negative electrode material. The different degradation modes are assumed to have unique and measurable effects on the open circuit voltage (OCV) of Li-ion cells and electrodes. The presumptive nature and extent of these effects has so far been based on logical arguments rather than experimental proof. This work presents, for the ﬁrst time, experimental evidence supporting the widely reported degradation modes by means of tests conducted on coin cells, engineered to include different, known amounts of lithium inventory and active electrode material. Moreover, the general theory behind the effects of degradation modes on the OCV of cells and electrodes is reﬁned and a diagnostic algorithm is devised, which allows the identiﬁcation and quantiﬁcation of the nature and extent of each degradation mode in Li-ion cells at any point in their service lives, by ﬁtting the cells' OCV.},

To fulﬁll the goal of long cycle life, accurate assessment for degradation of lithium-ion battery is necessary in hybrid energy management. This paper proposes an improved degradation model of lithium-ion battery based on the electrochemical mechanism of capacity fade, in which the inﬂuence of cycling current is taken into consideration. Moreover, genetic algorithm is applied to identify the initial values of model parameters. A particle ﬁlter based data driven framework is also designed to track the variation of model parameters and states during the cycling process. Short-term and long-term degradation prediction methods are then developed, to forecast the essential indicators of battery health. Datasets of battery cycling tests under both constant cycling current and dynamic cycling current are used for veriﬁcation. The root mean square error results for state of health prediction (less than 18 cycles) and remaining useful life prediction are below 8\% and 40 cycles, respectively, showing the accuracy and applicability of the proposed methods. Additionally, the baseline degradation prediction for case with cycling current information unknown is also illustrated.},

In fact, CV step is responsible in a major part of lithium intercalation into negative electrode and revealed to give signiﬁcation on cyclable lithium loss which is the major cause of calendar aging according to literature and post mortem analysis. Comparison from the aging of four battery technologies is presented. Through aging, results show a difference in battery behavior even if the time for CC charge is decreasing for all the battery.

Fast charging is desired for convenience improvements but may excessively degrade battery's health or even cause safety issues. This paper proposes a novel algorithm to manage battery charging operations using a model-based control approach. Based on a fully coupled electrothermal model, the fast charging strategy is formulated as a linear-time-varying model predictive control problem, for the ﬁrst time. Constraints are explicitly imposed to protect the battery from overcharging and overheating. To enable the state-feedback control, unmeasurable battery internal states including state-of-charge and core temperature are estimated via a nonlinear observer using noisy measurements of current, voltage, and surface temperature. Illustrative results demonstrate that the proposed approach is able to optimally balance time and temperature increase. In addition, it is shown from simulations that the model predictive control based charging algorithm appears promising for real-time implementation. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The battery voltage and negative surface temperature are collected by battery test system and auxiliary channels equipment. The experimental battery based on ﬁrst-order resistance and capacitance (RC) equivalent circuit and MATLAB/Simulink platform is simulated. The mean square error which indicates the difference between experiment and simulation is employed to describe voltage state of the cell. If the abnormal voltage exists, it is concluded that a fault occurs through analyzing the voltage abnormal coefﬁcients based on modiﬁed Z-score, which is considered as a seconddegree fault. The temperature rise rate is regarded as a secondary parameter to determine whether the second-degree fault deteriorates into a ﬁrst-degree fault.

In contrast to the most commonly applied Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS), NFRA is not limited to the linear response of the system, as it uses higher sinusoidal excitation currents IAC of approximately 1.5 C. Higher harmonic response signals Yn with n2 are analysed. Thereby, additional dynamic information about the system is accessible. Here, the authors evaluate the potential of NFRA to detect the safety critical ageing process of Lithium plating. NFRA results are analysed and compared to EIS for cells aged at À 10+C with plating occurence and for cells without plating aged at 25+C. A proof of concept for detection of Lithium plating with NFRA is presented. The third harmonic, Y3, is strongly sensitive to plated Lithium at time constants characteristic for electrochemical reactions for the analysed cells. Here, Lithium plating causes an increase of charge transfer resistance between the anode and the electrolyte, which affects the nonlinear behaviour. Ex-situ analysis validated that plating occurs only for the cells aged at À 10+C, but not for the cells aged at 25+C. Further, it is presented that Y1, analysed with EIS, is not sufﬁcient for the diagnosis of this ageing process. Therefore, NFRA is suggested as a new, reliable method for the identiﬁcation of Lithium plating in Lithium-ion batteries.},

	abstract = {The lifetime and safety of lithium-ion batteries are key requirements for successful market introduction of electro mobility. Especially charging at low temperature and fast charging, known to provoke lithium plating, is an important issue for automotive engineers. Lithium plating, leading both to ageing as well as safety risks, is known to play a crucial role in system design of the application. To gain knowledge of diﬀerent inﬂuence factors on lithium plating, low-temperature ageing tests are performed in this work. Commercial lithium-ion batteries of various types are tested under various operational conditions such as temperature, current, state of charge, charging strategy as well as state of health. To analyse the ageing behaviour, capacity fade and resistance increase are tracked over lifetime. The results of this large experimental survey on lithium plating provide support for the design of operation strategies for the implementation in battery management systems. To further investigate the underlying degradation mechanisms, diﬀerential voltage curves and impedance spectra are analysed and a post-mortem analysis of anode degradation is performed for a selected technology. The results conﬁrm the deposition of metallic lithium or lithium compounds in the porous structure and suggest a strongly inhomogeneous deposition over the electrode thickness with a dense deposition layer close to the separator for the considered cell. It is shown that this inhomogeneous deposition can even lead to loss of active material. The plurality of the investigated technologies demonstrates large diﬀerences between diﬀerent technologies concerning low-temperature behaviour and gives insight to the impact of cell properties. For the sample of cells considered in this work, cells rated to provide high power are found to be subject to faster degradation at low temperatures compared to high-energy cells, probably due to little self-heating. For application this result shows that cells designed for high current rates are not necessarily providing a good low-temperature performance.},

In this paper, two nonlinear models based on single and dual RC models are established, and observability of the nonlinear models is discussed. To bound the influence of model uncertainties, an ������∞ extended Kalman filter is proposed based on robust control theory to estimate the SOC, Ohmic and polarization resistances simultaneously. The performance and robustness of the proposed method are evaluated and compared with a standard extended Kalman filter using multi-temperature datasets.

	abstract = {Advanced battery management systems (BMS) in electric vehicles (EVs) require immediate and accurate battery state, such as State-of-Charge (SoC) and State-of-Health (SoH) for efficient monitoring and control. To improve the state estimation performance of battery, an electrochemical model is applied in this paper. First, the electrochemical model is reduced to describe the instantaneous Li-ion concentration dynamics of each electrode sufficiently without main information loss. Second, two separate sliding mode observers (SMOs) combined with reduced order electrochemical model are designed to identify SoC/SoH of lithium-ion cell from external measured voltage and current value. An estimation scheme which is comprised of two subestimators is designed. They work jointly: one separate sliding mode observer (SMO) for SoC estimation using Li-ion solid-electrolyte concentration and the other observer for cell contact resistance adopting Lyapunov’s stability theory. Finally, in order to demonstrate the performance of proposed scheme, the simulations are verified by experiments from a 2.3Ah high-power LiFePO4/graphite cell used in EVs. The results indicate that the proposed estimation scheme with the SMO algorithm performs well with initial error values. The maximum SoC and SoH estimation error are less than 3\% and 2.5\% under Urban Dynamometer Driving Schedule (UDDS) drive cycles.},

	abstract = {Lithium-ion batteries are used as the main power source in many electronic and electrical devices. In particular, with the growth in battery-powered electric vehicle development, the lithium-ion battery plays a critical role in the reliability of vehicle systems. In order to provide timely maintenance and replacement of battery systems, it is necessary to develop a reliable and accurate battery health diagnostic that takes a prognostic approach. Therefore, this paper focuses on two main methods to determine a battery's health: (1) Battery State-of-Health (SOH) monitoring and (2) Remaining Useful Life (RUL) prediction. Both of these are calculated by using a ﬁlter algorithm known as the Support Vector Regression-Particle Filter (SVR-PF). Models for battery SOH monitoring based on SVR-PF are developed with novel capacity degradation parameters introduced to determine battery health in real time. Moreover, the RUL prediction model is proposed, which is able to provide the RUL value and update the RUL probability distribution to the End-of-Life cycle. Results for both methods are presented, showing that the proposed SOH monitoring and RUL prediction methods have good performance and that the SVR-PF has better monitoring and prediction capability than the standard particle ﬁlter (PF).},

This paper presents a hybrid state-of-charge and state-of-health estimation technique according to adaptation of parameters in an equivalent circuit model and a Lyapunov-based adaptation law. The online adaptation of the equivalent circuit model is employed to maintain accurate estimations by capturing battery age-dependent dynamics. The Lyapunov-based adaptation law is employed to enable the production of internal battery state and age-dependent parameters estimations using only battery terminal voltage and noisy current measurements. Though parameters vary with aging, temperature or other factors, accurate estimations are still achieved without prior knowledge of battery parameters. Besides, the stability of the proposed observer can also be guaranteed by Lyapunov direct method. The proposed method is veriﬁed using data collected over randomized discharge proﬁles. Experimental results highlight the high estimation accuracy and robustness of the proposed model and technique.},

This paper proposes a multi-time-scale estimation algorithm for a class of nonlinear systems with coupled fast and slow dynamics. Based on a boundary-layer model and a reduced model, a multi-timescale estimator is proposed in which the design parameter sets can be tuned in different time-scales. Stability property of the estimation errors is analytically characterized by adopting a deterministic version of extended Kalman ﬁlter (EKF). This proposed algorithm is applied to estimator design for the state-of-charge (SOC) and state-of-health (SOH) in a lithium-ion battery using the developed reduced order battery models. Simulation results on a high ﬁdelity lithium-ion battery model demonstrate that the observer is effective in estimating SOC and SOH despite a range of common errors due to model order reductions, linearisation, initialisation and noisy measurement.},

	abstract = {Lithium-ion battery is a critical part in various industrial applications. In practice, the performance of such batteries degrades over time. To maintain the battery performance and ensure their reliability, it is important to implement on-line life cycle health state assessment in a battery management system. However, two big challenges in on-line battery actual capacity estimation must be overcome. The ﬁrst one is the on-line extraction of measurable degradation features. The other one is the on-line mapping from the degradation feature space to the battery capacity space. This paper proposes a self-adaptive lifecycle health state assessment method based on the on-line measurable parameters of lithium-ion battery. Ten different degradation features are extracted from the voltage, electric current and critical time during operation. These degradation features are fused to achieve a higher adaptability to complex operating conditions. The lithium-ion battery health state is assessed with a mapping model that links the feature space to the capacity space. The model is trained by the least squares support vector machine method for less computational complexity. The experimental results based on the real battery testing data show that the correlation between the degradation feature and the battery capacity is higher than 0.7 and the mean error of capacity estimation is less than 0.05. For the dynamic operation conditions, the mean error of capacity estimation is less than 11 mAh. This study illustrates the adaptability and applicability of the proposed on-line life-cycle health state assessment approach in various electric vehicle applications.},

However, current approaches to estimating the SOH of a lithium-ion battery are mainly ofﬂine or have not solved the accuracy and efﬁciency problems. This paper attempts to solve these problems. A dynamic information extraction method based on a fast discrete wavelet transform is proposed to greatly improve the algorithm efﬁciency. Dimension reduction is performed on the battery current and voltage time series using the maximum entropy partition method to individually generate a symbolic time series. A cross D-Markov machine model is built based on the causal symbolic time series to extract the feature parameter and represent the lithium-ion battery SOH. An accelerated aging experiment using LiFePO4 batteries is conducted to identify different aging stages. The results show that the feature parameter is an accurate representation of the lithium-ion battery SOH, the maximum error of SOH can be within 0.113, and the average error can be within 0.0509 in the entire battery life cycle. The proposed method is more suitable for online application than the previous method because its computation time is 250e290 times shorter.},

Secondly, the detailed expression of the current time constant is derived based on the ﬁrst order equivalent circuit model (ECM). Thirdly, the quantitative correlation between the normalized battery capacity and the current time constant is established to indicate the battery SoH.

	abstract = {Prognostics and health management of lithium-ion batteries, especially their remaining useful life (RUL) prediction, has attracted much attention in recent years because accurate battery RUL prediction is beneﬁcial to ensuring high reliability of lithium-ion batteries for providing power sources for many electronic products. In the common state space modeling of battery RUL prediction, noise variances are usually assumed to be ﬁxed. However, noise variances have great inﬂuence on state space modeling. If noise variances are too small, it takes long time for initial guess states to approach true states, and thus estimated states and measurements are biased. If noise variances are too large, state space modeling based ﬁltering will suffer divergence. Besides, even though a same type of lithium-ion batteries are investigated, their degradation paths vary quite differently in practice due to unit-to-unit variation, ambient temperature and other working conditions. Consequently, heterogeneity of noise variances should be taken into consideration in state space modeling so as to improve RUL prediction accuracy. More importantly, noise variances should be posteriorly updated by using up-to-date battery capacity degradation measurements. In this paper, an efﬁcient prognostic method for battery RUL prediction is proposed based on state space modeling with heterogeneity of noise variances. 26 lithium-ion batteries degradation data are used to illustrate how the proposed prognostic method works. Some comparisons with other common prognostic methods are conducted to show the superiority of the proposed prognostic method.},

	abstract = {Machine-learning based methods have been widely used for battery health state monitoring. However, the existing studies require sophisticated data processing for feature extraction, thereby complicating the implementation in battery management systems. This paper proposes a machine-learning technique, random forest regression, for battery capacity estimation. The proposed technique is able to learn the dependency of the battery capacity on the features that are extracted from the charging voltage and capacity measurements. The random forest regression is solely based on signals, such as the measured current, voltage and time, that are available onboard during typical battery operation. The collected raw data can be directly fed into the trained model without any pre-processing, leading to a low computational cost. The incremental capacity analysis is employed for the feature selection. The developed method is applied and validated on lithium nickel manganese cobalt oxide batteries with different ageing patterns. Experimental results show that the proposed technique is able to evaluate the health states of different batteries under varied cycling conditions with a root-mean-square error of less than 1.3\% and a low computational requirement. Therefore, the proposed method is promising for online battery capacity estimation.},

Dynamics of the cell are modeled using some equivalent circuit models and parameters of each model are calculated by adaptive particle swarm optimization. The modeling process involves modeling and parametric uncertainties as well as measurement and instrumentation noise. They may degrade the performance of an optimal filter for SOC and SOH estimation. To alleviate effects of such uncertain factors, the smooth variable structure filter (SVSF) is implemented. The SVSF is a novel robust state estimation method that benefits from the robustness property of variable structure systems. The performance of the SVSF is compared with the extended Kalman filter (EKF) for real-time SOC estimation of a healthy and an aged Lithium polymer cell. The paper moreover presents a novel method for SOH estimation using the SVSF’s chattering signal and without the need for modeling the cell undergoes aging. Experiments show performance benefits of the SVSF for reliable SOC and SOH estimation of healthy and aged Lithium polymer cells.},

A three-order polynomial model is employed to ﬁt the battery health degradation process, remaining useful life is predicted using a particle ﬁlter algorithm, and the probability density function for the battery remaining useful life is then provided. A case study is conducted to validate the health degradation model and battery remaining useful life prediction. The results show that the constant voltage charge time is not a good health indicator, and a threshold of 0.85 is recommended as the end-of-life criterion based on the integrated health indicator.

Through a new validation method, the proposed PSO–SVR model in this paper can well grasp the global degradation trend of SOH and is little affected by local regeneration and ﬂuctuations. The case study shows that compared with the eight published methods, the proposed model can obtain more accurate SOH prediction results. Even SOH prediction starts from the cycle near capacity regeneration, the proposed model still can grasp the global degradation trend. Furthermore, the improved PSO–SVR model has great robustness when the training data contain noise and measurement outliers, which makes it possible to get satisfactory prediction performance without pre-processing the data manually.},

	abstract = {Two time-varying linear state-space representations of the generally accepted physicochemical model (PCM) of a lithium-ion cell are used to estimate local and global states during diﬀerent charging scenarios. In terms of computational speed and suitability towards recursive state observer models, the solid-phase diﬀusion in the PCM of an exemplaric MCMB/LiCoO2 lithium-ion cell is derived with the aid of two diﬀerent numerical reduction methods in the form of a Polynomial Proﬁle and an Eigenfunction Method. As a benchmark, the PCM using the original Duhamel Superposition Integral approximation serves for the comparison of accuracy and computational speed. A modiﬁed spatial discretization via the ﬁnite volume method improves handling of boundary conditions and guarantees accurate simulation results of the PCM even at a low level of spatial discretization. The Polynomial Proﬁle allows for a signiﬁcant speed-up in computational time whilst showing a poor prediction accuracy during dynamic load proﬁles. The Eigenfunction Method shows a comparable accuracy as the benchmark for all load proﬁles whilst resulting in an even higher computational eﬀort. The two derived observer models incorporate the state-space representation of the reduced PCM applying both the Polynomial and Eigenfunction approach combined with an Extended Kalman Filter algorithm based on a novel initialization algorithm and conservation of lithium mass. The estimation results of both models show robust and quick reduction of the residual errors for both local and global states when considering the applied current and the resulting cell voltage of the benchmark model, as the underlying measurement signal. The carried out state estimation for a 4C constant charge current showed a regression of the cell voltage error to 1 mV within 30 s with an initial SOC error of 42.4\% under a standard deviation of 10 mV and including process noise.},

The proposed methods do not require initial values, and dynamic impedance provides a more accurate reﬂection of the electrical characteristics of batteries compared to conventional estimation methods. This approach also enables calculations in real-time. The SOH of batteries degenerates with age, which also alters the characteristics of dynamic impedance. The proposed projection method determines the SOH according to the rate of change in dynamic impedance with respect to the SOC. We also developed a real-time SOC and SOH estimation system, combining a microcontroller and estimation methods with a battery management system (BMS). The BMS retrieves the data required for SOC and SOH estimation and includes various protection mechanisms designed to extend the lifespan of the battery.

This first-principles based model is a coupled system of partial and ordinary differential equations, which is a reduced version of the Doyle–Fuller–Newman model. More precisely, the subsystem of Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) is the Single Particle Model (SPM) while the Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) is a model for the average temperature in the battery. The observer is designed following the PDE backstepping method. Since some coefficients in the coupled ODE–PDE system are time-varying, this results in the time dependency of some coefficients in the kernel function system of the backstepping transformation and it is non-trivial to show well-posedness of the latter system. Adding thermal dynamics to the SPM serves a two-fold purpose: improving the accuracy of SoC estimation and keeping track of the average temperature which is a critical variable for safety management in lithium-ion batteries. Effectiveness of the estimation scheme is validated via numerical simulations.},

We present the results of long term aging studies in which we observe stack stress to be linearly related to cell SOH for cells aged with different cycling parameters. The observed increases in stack stress are attributed to irreversible volumetric expansion of the electrodes. We discuss the use of stress measurements for SOC determination, which offers the advantage of being more sensitive to SOC than voltage as well as the ability to measure SOC in the presence of self discharge. Finally we present a simple model to explain the linear nature of the observed stress-SOH relationship. The inherent simplicity of the mechanical measurements and their relationships to SOH and SOC presented in this paper offer potential utility for the improvement of existing battery management systems.},

An improved battery model, which combines the open-circuit-voltage modeling and the Thevenin equivalent circuit model, is proposed to improve the model accuracy and study the relation between internal parameters and states of the battery. The joint extended Kalman ﬁlter-recursive-least squares algorithm is employed to estimate battery state-of-charge and identify the model parameters and open-circuit-voltage simultaneously. Then a particle swarm optimization-least square support vector regression approach is employed to give a reliable state-of-health estimation result with high accuracy and good generalization ability, where the particle swarm optimization algorithm is used to improve the algorithm ability of global optimization. In order to verify the accuracy of the proposed method, static and dynamic current proﬁle tests are carried out on lithium iron phosphate batteries in diﬀerent aging levels. The experimental results indicate that the proposed method can present suitability for state-of-health estimation with high accuracy.},

	abstract = {Electrochemical models of lithium-ion batteries have been increasingly considered for online state of health estimation. These models can more accurately predict cell performance than traditional circuit models and can better relate physical degradation mechanisms to changes in model parameters. However, examples of state of health estimation algorithms that are validated with experimental data are scarce in the literature, particularly for cells with a composite electrode. The individual electrode active materials in a composite electrode may degrade at different rates and according to different physical mechanisms, and online estimation of this degradation facilitates more robust knowledge of how battery performance changes over its life. In this paper we use a reduced-order electrochemical model for a composite LiMn2O4-LiNi1/3Mn1/3 Co1/3O2 (LMO-NMC) electrode cell for online estimation of active material loss. Experimental data collected from composite electrode half cells that were aged under constant current cycling are used in an extended Kalman ﬁlter to estimate model parameters associated with loss of each active material. The capacity loss predicted by the online estimates agrees well with the measured capacity loss. Additionally, a differential capacity analysis demonstrates that active materials lose capacity at a similar rate, the same conclusion obtained from the online estimation algorithm.},

	abstract = {State of health estimation is critical for ensuring the safety and dependability of lithium-ion batteries. In practical usage, batteries are seldom completely discharged. With a constant current-constant voltage charging mode, the incomplete discharging process inﬂuences the initial charging voltage and the charging time of the subsequent constant current charging, greatly hindering the applications of many traditional health indicators that require a full cycling process. However, the charging data of the constant voltage charging is fully reserved, and is not affected by the previous incomplete discharging process. Furthermore, the charging current curve during the constant voltage proﬁle is discovered to relate with the battery state of health in this study. Therefore, a new health indicator is extracted only from the monitoring parameters of the constant voltage proﬁle for state of health estimation. The battery aging phenomena during the constant voltage proﬁle are ﬁrstly characterized by the equivalent circuit model, and a new indicator is then constructed. A framework for the online extraction of this indicator of is proposed. Additionally, the correlation analysis and performance assessment prove the adaptability and effectiveness of the proposed method for estimating state of health of lithium-ion batteries.},

Six retired LiFePO4 batteries are selected to conduct cycle life tests under three typical load proﬁles for energy storage applications. By adopting incremental capacity analysis (ICA) and IC peak area analysis, aging mechanisms in the batteries are studied. All the batteries have shown the same aging pattern with a combination of loss of lithium inventory (LLI) and loss of active materials on negative electrodes (LAMNE). The LLI and LAMNE are analyzed in a quantitative manner to detect the similarities and differences among the batteries operated under different load proﬁles. To estimate the battery remaining capacity, three types of regression methods are proposed and compared. The features of IC curves are used as inputs to the regression models. The results show that the estimation errors with ordinary least squares (OLS) regression and ridge regression methods are within 2\%, and that ridge regression has lower root mean square error than OLS regression. Using correlation-based feature selection methods, a universal index that is feasible for all batteries is presented for regression analysis, and the estimation error is found to be within 3\%.},

In this study, the mechanical integrity and electrical coupling behaviors of lithium-ion pouch cells under dynamical loading were investigated. Two types of experiments, namely compression and drop-weight tests, are designed and conducted. The state-of-charge (SOC) and loading rate dependencies of batteries, as well as their coupling effect, are examined. Furthermore, the interaction between force response and electrical behavior of battery is investigated through real-time monitoring of voltage change during loading. Experiments on LiCoO2 lithium-ion pouch cells show that the higher SOC and loading rates increases battery structure stiffness. In addition, loading rate intensiﬁes battery structure stiffening with the SOC effect. Results indicate that the deformation and material failure of battery component together determine the electrical behavior of battery. Higher loading rate leads to faster voltage drop and more severe internal short-circuit. This short-circuit discharging process in turn affects the force response in dynamic loading. Results may provide useful insights into the fundamental understanding of electrical and mechanical coupled integrity of LIBs and lay a solid basis for their crash safety design.},

The mathematical basis of the four methods are in agreement. Moreover, the PDF method and the ICA/DVA have an equivalence veriﬁed by mathematical derivation. Thus the results acquired by the PDF and the ICA/DVA are quite similar. LiFePO4 and LiMn2O4 batteries are tested to demonstrate the PDF method. Coin cells are tested by the PDF and the CV methods. Results show that the PDF curves and the CV curves have similar shapes. In addition, durability tests are conducted on four commercial batteries to analyze the aging regularities using the PDF method. The PDF results show that the height of the peak reduces as the battery capacity fades. Employing the regularity of peak height reduction with battery aging, an algorithm is proposed to evaluate the SOH online. The PDF method extends the application of the ICA/DVA method.

An improved single particle (SP) model is introduced with high precision and the same level of computations as the original single particle model. A simpliﬁed pseudotwo-dimensional (SP2D) model is developed. The distribution of the pore wall ﬂux is analyzed and an approximate method is developed to ﬁnd the solution.

The results demonstrate that the models introduced in this work could simulate the battery efﬁciently without too much loss of accuracy.

	abstract = {Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is an effective technique for diagnosing the behaviour of electrochemical devices such as batteries and fuel cells, usually by ﬁtting data to an equivalent circuit model (ECM). The common approach in the laboratory is to measure the impedance spectrum of a cell in the frequency domain using a single sine sweep signal, then ﬁt the ECM parameters in the frequency domain. This paper focuses instead on estimation of the ECM parameters directly from time-domain data. This may be advantageous for parameter estimation in practical applications such as automotive systems including battery-powered vehicles, where the data may be heavily corrupted by noise. The proposed methodology is based on the simpliﬁed reﬁned instrumental variable for continuous-time fractional systems method (‘srivcf’), provided by the Crone toolbox [1,2], combined with gradientbased optimisation to estimate the order of the fractional term in the ECM. The approach was tested ﬁrst on synthetic data and then on real data measured from a 26650 lithium-ion iron phosphate cell with low-cost equipment. The resulting Nyquist plots from the time-domain ﬁtted models match the impedance spectrum closely (much more accurately than when a Randles model is assumed), and the ﬁtted parameters as separately determined through a laboratory potentiostat with frequency domain ﬁtting match to within 13\%.},

A novel liquid coolant based thermal management system, for 18,650 battery pack has been introduced herein. This system is designed to be compact and economical without compromising safety. A coupled three-dimensional (3D) electrochemical thermal model is constructed for the proposed Li-ion battery pack. The model is used to evaluate the effects of different operating conditions like coolant ﬂow-rate and discharge current on the pack temperature. Contact resistance is found to have the strongest impact on the thermal performance of the pack. From the numerical solution, a simple and novel temperature correlation of predicting the temperatures of all the individual cells given the temperature measurement of one cell is devised and validated with experimental results. Such coefﬁcients have great potential of reducing the sensor requirement and complexity in a large Li-ion battery pack, typical of an electric vehicle.},

Much existing work has been carried out on incumbent Lithium-ion (Li-ion) technologies, but these are reaching their theoretical limits and modern research is also exploring promising next-generation technologies such as Lithium–Sulphur (Li–S). This study reviews and discusses various battery modelling approaches including mathematical models, electrochemical models and electrical equivalent circuit models. After a general survey, the study explores the speciﬁc application of battery models in EV battery management systems, where models may have low ﬁdelity to be fast enough to run in real-time applications. Two main categories are considered: reduced-order electrochemical models and equivalent circuit models. The particular challenges associated with Li–S batteries are explored, and it is concluded that the state-of-the-art in battery modelling is not sufﬁcient for this chemistry, and new modelling approaches are needed.},

Two variations of the lithium-ion cell chemistry, namely the lithium-ion iron phosphate (LiFePO4) and lithium nickelmanganese-cobalt oxide (LiNMC) are used for testing purposes. The model parameters and states are recursively estimated using a nonlinear system identiﬁcation technique based on the dual Extended Kalman Filter (dual-EKF) algorithm. The dynamic performance of the model structures are veriﬁed using the results obtained from a self-designed pulsed-current test and an electric vehicle (EV) drive cycle based on the New European Drive Cycle (NEDC) proﬁle over a range of operating temperatures. Analysis on the ten model structures are conducted with respect to state-of-charge (SOC) and state-of-power (SOP) estimation with erroneous initial conditions. Comparatively, both RC model structures provide the best dynamic performance, with an outstanding SOC estimation accuracy. For those cell chemistries with large inherent hysteresis levels (e.g. LiFePO4), the RC model with only one time constant is combined with a dynamic hysteresis model to further enhance the performance of the SOC estimator.},

Electrical equivalent models (EEMs) are often used in automotive industry due to their efficiency. However, aging extensions for EEMs are typically based on empirical relations and fail outside their design scope. Single particle models (SPMs) on the other hand, are one of the simplest forms of electrochemical models which might still be suitable for automotive applications. Although EEM and SPM are differently motivated and developed, cross connections between both model types are discussed. Based on a simplification of SPM aging relations, a more comprehensive empirical aging model for EEMs denoted by SPM–EEM is described and compared to already existing models. As an example, both models are adjusted to fit a LiMn2O4 (LMO) cell chemistry. The derived SPM–EEM shows first promising results to improve the accuracy. Even though SPMs are slightly superior in predictability than EEMs, they are often too complex to run on control devices. Improving the predictability of EEMs is, therefore, an important step to improve aging estimation and optimization for automotive applications.},

	abstract = {The most commonly used type of lithium-ion battery model in current battery management systems is the equivalent circuit model (ECM), but ECMs can predict only the input/output dynamics of cells but not internal electrochemical states. Since knowledge of these internal electrochemical states is needed to devise controls that can directly mitigate premature aging, researchers increasingly demand advanced control-oriented electrochemical models. Historically, electrochemical models have been computationally complex; in order to reduce this computational complexity many eﬀorts have been made to simplify the original electrochemical model. However, in order to facilitate the application of the electrochemical model, there are still two issues to address: (1) electrochemical parameter identiﬁcation and (2) taking into account the electric double layer and constantphase-element (CPE) dynamics. In this paper, we ﬁrst reformulate the original electrochemical model using lumped parameters to produce a full-order model (FOM) with the number of parameters reduced from 36 down to 24. All redundant/unobservable parameters are eliminated, and thus a minimum set of parameters are obtained, making system identiﬁcation possible. Then, a series of lumped-parameter transfer functions are derived using only the required assumption of linearity. CPEs are added to the transfer functions to capture more accurately dynamic behavior of real cells. The derived lumped-parameter transfer functions are used to generate a lumped-parameter discrete-time state-space model. Time-domain data are generated by a virtual battery cell created via COMSOL using the FOM as a benchmark for comparison. Testing results under diﬀerent conditions shows an overall improvement in estimation of cell voltage and state variables for a cell having realistic doublelayer capacitance by using the lumped-parameter reduced-order model with CPE.},

	abstract = {Temperature and cell aging are two major factors that inﬂuence the reliability and safety of Li-ion batteries. A general battery model considering both temperature and degradation is often diﬃcult to develop, given the fact that there are many diﬀerent types of cells with diﬀerent shapes and/or internal chemical components. In response, a migration-based framework is proposed in this paper for battery modeling, in which the eﬀects of temperature and aging are treated as uncertainties. An accurate model for a fresh cell is established ﬁrst and then migrated to the degraded batteries through a Bayes Monte Carlo method. Experiments are carried out on both LiFePO4 batteries and Li(Ni1/3Co1/3Mn1/3) O2 batteries under various ambient temperatures and aging levels. The results indicate that the typical voltage prediction error can be limited within ±20 mV, for the cases of temperature change up to 40 °C, and capacity degradation up to 20\%. The proposed method paves ways to an eﬀective battery management and energy control for electric vehicles or micro grid applications.},

	abstract = {Accurate parameter identiﬁcation and state of charge (SoC) estimation of a Li-ion battery are a critical issue for efﬁcient monitoring, control and utilization of advanced battery management system (BMS) in electric vehicles. The existing single-particle model with electrolyte dynamics (SPMe) can accurately describe the Li-ion cell's macro-micro scale dynamic behaviors, but they are vulnerable as predictive tools under speciﬁc operating conditions, which is more prone to erroneous estimation results. To overcome this problem, this paper proposes a parameter identiﬁcation scheme with its systematic validation for an enhanced electrochemical aging model of the cylindrical 18650 Li-ion nickel manganese cobalt oxide (NMC) cell under the typical experimental testing scenarios. First, a SPMe-based aging degradation model is developed through including Solid-Electrolyte-Interface (SEI) layer formation at the negative electrode, denoted as eSPMA model. Next, the dozens of parameters in this eSPMA model are evaluated using the conventional genetic algorithm and the validation of these identiﬁed parameters is conducted under different operating conditions, and simultaneously, this eSPMA model is used to estimate Li-ion batteries SoC under the same operation scenarios. Finally, the effectiveness of the identiﬁed parameter is validated by a comparative study of the simulated and experimental voltage and SoC under the same input current proﬁle based on the eSPMA and the DoyleeFullereNewman (DFN) model. The results of this study can assist in the experiment design of battery capacity degradation and facilitate the accurate estimation of state-of-health for advanced battery management system in the electriﬁed vehicle applications.},

Only standard passive components are used to construct the equivalent circuit, which reﬂects the fact that a Li-ion battery is an energy storage device. Voltages across and currents through the circuit elements in the ECM are identiﬁed with the respective internal electrochemical processes in the battery, thus allowing the parametric values of circuit elements to be expressed as functions of the Li-ion concentrations and temperature. Variations in the parametric values across the thickness of the battery leads to a distributed-parameter ECM amenable for wide range of applications. Furthermore, in contrast to existing reduced-order models of Li-ion battery which are described by differential algebraic equations, the ECM is governed by ordinary different equations wherein all the circuit components are expressed as explicit functions of the state and input variables. Hence, the developed model allows solution to be found directly using matrix algebra, resulting in rapid simulation study suitable for the development of computationally-efﬁcient real-time battery control algorithm. Results of simulation based on the developed distributedparameter ECM show close agreement with those obtained from a partial differential equation based P2D model under wide range of applied current rate, but at a much reduced computational burden.},

Parameter identiﬁcation of electrochemical models is essential but present methods are time-consuming and complex. In the “Part1” paper in this series, a lumped-parameter electrochemical model was built with the redundant/unobservable parameters removed. Using the this model, this paper proposes a novel stepwise method that can identify the whole set of parameter values for a physical cell using simple tests. The lumpedparameter model is speciﬁcally reformulated mostly based on frequency decomposition, and a reference electrode is included in the model to achieve electrode decoupling. The method is decomposed into four tests and eight steps, where the number of parameters to be identiﬁed in each step is signiﬁcantly reduced, enhancing the computational eﬃciency and improving the identiﬁcation accuracy. The identiﬁed values are ﬁrst directly compared to the true values, and then the time-domain predictions of the lumped-parameter model using the identiﬁed values are compared to those of the full-order model using the true parameter values in terms of the terminal voltage and electrochemical states under diﬀerent operation conditions.},

This paper simultaneously evaluates three mainstream types of modelling techniques for calendar ageing prediction of Lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries. They are the pseudo two dimensional (P2D)-based electrochemical model, Arrhenius law-based semi-empirical model, and Gaussian process regression (GPR)-based data-driven model. Specifically, both the electrochemical and semi-empirical models are consciously developed or selected from the state-of-the-art modelling literature. For the data-driven model, due to the limited research in the existing publications, a machine learning-enabled GPR model is derived and applied for calendar ageing pre­ diction. An experimental setup is developed to load the commercial Panasonic NCR18650BD batteries and to collect the experimental calendar ageing data under different storage temperature and SOC levels over 435 days. Based upon this well-rounded database, each model is well trained through using its corresponding training solution. Then the prediction performances of these models are studied and evaluated in terms of the model accuracy, generalization ability and uncertainty management. Both the challenges and future prospects of each model type are highlighted to assist the industrial and academic research communities, thus boosting the progress of designing advanced modelling techniques in battery calendar ageing prediction domain.},

In this work, the parameter sensitivity of the 2RC model with one-state hysteresis (2RCH) is investigated to determine the crucial parameters. Firstly, the model parameters of 2RCH is identiﬁed using particle swarm optimization under dynamic working conditions. Secondly, the sensitivity analysis of parameters in 2RCH for two types of batteries is qualitatively examined using the one-factor-at-a-time method. Thirdly, a simpliﬁed model, in which the crucial parameters with high sensitivities are updated with SOC and SOH, while the other parameters retain their initial values, is proposed to ensure model accuracy while reducing computational complexity greatly. Finally, SOC estimation based on the simpliﬁed ECM for two types of batteries over the whole SOC range under different SOHs is performed using the extended Kalman ﬁlter. The experimental results show that the SOC accuracy obtained by updating the crucial parameters is almost the same as that obtained by updating all parameters. The simpliﬁed model is beneﬁcial to avoid unnecessary repeated calculation of model parameters for different SOC and SOH ranges in the SOC estimation.},

In this study, we report the correlation between capacity loss and cell impedance changes in the battery due to lithium electrodeposition. Liion pouch cells with nickel-manganese-cobalt cathode and graphite anode were charged at rates varying from 0.5C to 6C. The cell voltage evolution immediately after charging was monitored to identify the C-rates that result in lithium plating. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was used to monitor the cell impedance evolution. The impedance of battery cells at C-rates lower than 1C and no lithium plating showed minimal changes from their baseline values in the period immediately after charging. However, the impedance of battery cells undergoing lithium plating and C-rates higher than 3C showed a substantial reduction immediately after charging, with recovery back to baseline values after 30 min of relaxation. These observations suggest that lithium plating causes damage to the solid electrolyte interface (SEI) layer on the anode particles during the charging period, followed by the reformation of the SEI during the relaxation period. The measured capacity loss has a linear correlation with observed impedance change. The linear relationship suggests that impedance monitoring may be used for prognostication of the state-of-health of Li-ion batteries.},

Lithium-ion batteries are found to be suitable for hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) and pure electric vehicles (EVs), and temperature control on lithium batteries is vital for long-term performance and durability. Unfortunately, battery thermal management (BTM) has not been paid close attention partly due to poor understanding of battery thermal behaviour. Cell performance change dramatically with temperature, but it improves with temperature if a suitable operating temperature window is sustained. This paper provides a review on two aspects that are battery thermal model development and thermal management strategies. Thermal effects of lithium-ion batteries in terms of thermal runaway and response under cold temperatures will be studied, and heat generation methods are discussed with aim of performing accurate battery thermal analysis. In addition, current BTM strategies utilised by automotive suppliers will be reviewed to identify the imposing challenges and critical gaps between research and practice. Optimising existing BTMs and exploring new technologies to mitigate battery thermal impacts are required, and efforts in prioritising BTM should be made to improve the temperature uniformity across the battery pack, prolong battery lifespan, and enhance the safety of large packs.},

However, such a test method re­ quires at least two to four months of the test period and requires repeated tests upon any change in the battery designs or chemistries. As a result, this lengthy evaluation process significantly delays the overall product development. For this reason, Samsung develops a fast evaluation method to test the stability of LiBs using a set of symmetric charge and discharge pulses at high C-rates. This set causes side reactions within the cell, which in turn lowers the state-of-charge and coulombic efficiencies (CE) of the cell compared to that before applying the pulses. By comparing the CE of the cycles with and without the pulses, the stability of LiBs in fast charge and discharge conditions are quantitatively evaluated. It is believed that the method presented in this work can reduce the evaluation time significantly, from several months to less than three days, which is beneficial to general battery research activities by significantly reducing time, resources, and cost.},

The relationship between the open-circuit voltage(OCV) and the SOC is essential for the ECMs, which is commonly obtained through the incremental OCV(IO) test or the lowcurrent OCV(LO) test and requires a long experimental time. Meanwhile, the SOC is usually deﬁned as the ratio of the remaining capacity to the nominal capacity, which reduces the accuracy of SOC estimation owing to the change of the available capacity under actual conditions. In this paper, the recursive least square with forgetting factor(FFRLS) is applied to identify the parameters including the OCV values based on the Thevenin model. Afterwards, the differential equations of the OCV and available capacity with respect to time are established, respectively. And then an adaptive extended Kalman ﬁlter(AEKF) is used to identify the OCV and available capacity. The estimated OCV and available capacity are input to a second AEKF for SOC estimation, and neither IO nor LO test is required. The proposed method is veriﬁed by experiments. The results indicate that the estimated SOC presents high accuracy and good robustness to the noises and different initial SOC values at different temperatures.},

Also, the CCV traction by the SO-ECM is 0.80 V and has fast initial convergence and quick prediction error reduction characteristics. The constructed iterative calculation model promotes the accurate SOC and CCV co-prediction effect, improving the safety and longevity of lithium-ion batteries with high precision and fast convergence advantages.},

	abstract = {The equilibrium state of the lithium-ion battery refers to a state where concentration of lithium ions within the solid and the liquid becomes uniformly distributed, and as a result, no potential difference is present. This steady state is particularly required for measurements of cell properties such as open circuit voltage (OCV), entropy coefficient (dOCV/dT) and impedances by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Currently, it takes hours or even days of relaxation to reach the equilibrium state at a given state of charge (SOC) after charging or discharging, which prolongs the entire preparation time prior to actual measurements. In this work, a new equilibration method is developed using optimal time control based on an electrochemical model. The optimal time control is numerically solved by employing a direct solution approach to obtain an optimal current profile. Experimental results have shown that equilibration can be accelerated, so measurement time can be significantly reduced. For large format pouch type lithium-ion cells, the measurement time is reduced up to 58.3\% compared with that by the current pulse-relaxation method at three different SOCs at 25 ◦C. In addition, the method is applied and experimentally tested at 40 ◦C and 10 ◦C and the effectiveness is verified.},

	abstract = {The maximum extractable power from lithium-ion batteries is a crucial performance metric both in terms of safety assessment and to plan prudent corrective action to avoid sudden power loss/shutdown. However, precise estimation of state of power remains a challenge because of the highly non-linear behaviour of batteries that are further aggravated at extremities of temperature as well as battery state of charge. To address this issue, we present the current limit estimate (CLE), which is determined using a robust electrochemical-thermal reduced order model, as a function of the pulse duration, depth of discharge, pre-set voltage cut-off and importantly the temperature. The CLE calculated from the model is experimentally validated using commercial mobile phone cells. With cell temperatures varying from 0 ◦C to 65 ◦C and full range of depths of discharge, the model gives a prediction accuracy of more than 98\%. The model is computationally efficient and compact enough to be implemented on battery management systems for on-board, real time state of power estimation. Further, key insights on what limits power capability of a battery are drawn through an analysis of contributions of different kinetic and transport processes to the cell resistance as a function of temperature and depth of discharge.},

The model is divided in two interacting parts: the electrical and the thermal one. The electrical model consists of one Resistor-Capacitor branch circuit that is coupled to a thermal model consisting of a discretized volume, representing the battery cell, built on the basis of the thermal-electrical analogy. The heat generated by the cell is estimated using a lumped heat source approach. One of the novel aspects of the work is the deﬁnition and detailed description of an automatic procedure to extract the parameters of the RC circuit from pulse discharge tests, based on a Multi-Linear Regression Model approach. The electrical and thermal performance of the model was validated with dynamic and static measured data: the mean square error of the voltage prediction in dynamic conditions is 0.00027 V2. In static conditions, the mean square error of the voltage and temperature predictions are 0.014 V2 and 2.28  C2, respectively. This model, due to its ease of application, can be used as a tool to deﬁne new modules architecture, as well as to support the design of the battery cooling system. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {To optimize costs and ensure safety, investigation and modeling of battery aging is very important. Calendar aging analysis consist of a periodic sequence of calendar aging and cell characterization. The influence of the characterization on the results of the calendar aging investigation has been assumed to be negligible so far. Nevertheless, the characterization measurements of different studies, especially the important capacity measurement, differ fundamentally. This could have an impact on the results of capacity and resistance change in calendar aging. In this paper, the effect of characterization is quantified for the first time, using periodic characterization measurements. A significant influence in the form of capacity increase and resistance decrease is found. It can be explained by an increase in the active electrode surface area caused by the characterization measurement. Therefore, the cell characterization is a new possible source for capacity increase in calendar aging. As an important result, in future studies capacity measurements should be performed with small currents below 1C to reduce the influence of characterization on the results. Additionally, a correction of the characterization effect can be done according to the presented method.},

The comprehension of these mechanisms is a prerequisite for design and operation of long-life lithium-ion cells. The degradation mechanisms are evaluated in dependence of cycle temperature, cut-off voltage, depth of discharge and discharge current, performing an extensive post-mortem analysis on cells subjected to a one-year-long cycle test. The main degradation mechanisms in the cells cycled at 60 ◦C are the large formation of gas, gas-assisted lithium plating, and, additionally, temperature-accelerated growth of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI), as revealed by XPS depth-profiling. The growth of the SEI is intensified by using higher cut-off voltages, while transition metal dissolution is observed via STEM. The man­ ganese ions incorporate into the SEI, causing a strong blue coloration of the anodes’ surface. The major effect in the cells cycled at high depth of discharge is the loss of cathode active material, as revealed by ICP-OES, XRD, and FIB-SEM measurements. The variation of the discharge current has no effect on the type of degradation mechanism occurring in the cells cycled at 20\% depth of discharge.},

Diverse usage patterns, variability in the devices housing the batteries, and diversity in their operating conditions pose significant challenges for this task. The contributions of this paper are three-fold. First, a public dataset is used to characterize the behavior of battery internal resistance. Internal resistance has non-linear dynamics as the battery ages, making it an excellent candidate for reliable battery health prediction during early cycles. Second, using these findings, battery health prediction models for different operating conditions are developed. The best models are more than 95\% accurate in predicting battery health using the internal resistance dynamics of 100 cycles at room temperature. Thirdly, instantaneous voltage drops due to multiple pulse discharge loads are shown to be capable of characterizing battery heterogeneity in as few as five cycles. The results pave the way toward improved battery models and better efficiency within the production and use of lithium-ion batteries.},

More importantly, with the same average current, current profile with a decrease trend leads to higher lithium production, purity and lower energy consumption. Through simulation on dynamic ion diffusion, we demonstrate the current with decreasing trend reduces the concentration polarization of Li+ near the electrode and induce better performance. At last, we prove the concentration polarization also exist and can be relieved by current manipulation in Li+ extraction from real sea water.

Energy efficiency of the pulse power source coupled with a LIB at different pulse charge voltages is examined. A peak value efficiency of 22.9\% is observed at a pulse charging voltage of 8.0 V mode. All-atom classical molecular dynamics simulations suggest that the different diffusion coefficients of Li ion in electrolyte under different applied voltage may be responsible for the different energy efficiencies. Moreover, the cycle performances of the LIBs with intermittent and continuous pulse charging were also investigated. Bad cycling performance of LIBs at pulse charging modes is ascribed to the pulverization of electrode particles arising from the larger strain during cycling, which is corroborated by the software simulation. Based on these results, we further designed a better procedure by combining galvanostatic charge-discharge (GCD) mode with pulse charging mode to improve the battery performance.},

	abstract = {Lithium plating in working batteries has attracted wide attention in the exploration of safe energy storage. Establishing an effective and rapid early-warning method is strongly considered but quite challenging since lithium plating behavior is determined by diverse factors. In this contribution, we present a non-destructive electrochemical detection method based on transient state analysis and threeelectrode cell conﬁguration. Through dividing the iR drop value by the current density, the as-obtained impedance quantity (Ri) can serve as a descriptor to describe the change of electrochemical reaction impedance on the graphite anode. The onset of lithium plating can be identiﬁed from the sharp drop of Ri. Once the dendritic plated lithium occurs, the extra electrochemical reactions at the lithium interfaces leads to growing active area and reduced surface resistance of the anode. We proposed a protocol to operate the batteries under the limited capacity, which renders the cell with 98.2\% capacity retention after 1000 cycles without lithium plating. The early-warning method has also been validated in in-situ optical microscopy batteries and practical pouch cells, providing a general but effective method for online lithium plating detection towards safe batteries.},

Since the operating load profile has a strong impact on the degradation of lithium-ion cells, dedicated experimental tests can provide important information in this regard. Herein, a commercial high power 18,650-type LiCoO2-LiNiCoMnO2/Graphite cell was aged according to a standardized endurance test from IEC 61,427–2), which profile is formulated to simulate the primary frequency regulation service. In addition, accelerated ageing was obtained by increasing the ambient temperature to 45 ◦C. Then, a deep investigation was performed to assess the main degradation phenomena induced by the operating profile. For this purpose, in­ cremental capacity (IC) and differential voltage (DV) analysis as well as electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) were performed at different state of health (SoH) of the cell. Moreover, in order to estimate the effects induced by the frequency regulation profile in comparison to the degradation phenomena caused by a typical full charge/discharge profile, an identical cell was also aged under this condition. Experimental evidences indicate that the operation under primary frequency regulation is less detrimental for the cell by capacity loss point of view, while larger internal impedance increase was observed in comparison to the typical full charge/discharge profile. Finally, a thermal acceleration coefficient was extrapolated to describe the cell capacity loss at room temperature under frequency regulation profile.},

However, building accurate models to characterize the inherent nonlinear dynamic properties of electrochemical processes is still a challenge for control-oriented applications. Instead of building a model independently from physical laws or experimental data, a linear parameter-varying (LPV) modeling method for lithium-ion batteries is pro­ posed in this research. In the LPV modeling structure, the nonlinear relationships are considered to be dependent on the so-called scheduling variables. In combination with the subspace identification algorithm, a global method is proposed to identify the LPV battery model based on a single data set with constantly changing scheduling variables. The validity of this modeling approach is verified by an experimental study of lithium iron phosphate (LiFePO4) cells. Experimental results reveal that state-of-charge (SOC) and SOC change rate are key scheduling variables that determine the model nonlinearities, and the identified model provides good results in terms of prediction accuracy and robustness. Meanwhile, comparison results show that the global LPV modeling approach can describe the nonlinear battery dynamics adequately with first-order model, which makes it a promising method for control-oriented applications.},

Utilizing the features from the terminal voltage response of the Li-ion battery under current pulse test, a new method is proposed in this paper by using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) technique for accurately estimating the battery SOH. Since the terminal voltage measured at the same condition varies with the battery aging process, the features for SOH estimation are extracted from the voltage response under a speciﬁc current pulse test. The beneﬁt of the proposed method is that the features come from the short-term test, which is much convenient to be obtained in real applications. After applying the short term current pulse test (few seconds), the keen points and the slopes in the voltage response curve are selected as the potential candidate features. In order to ﬁnd the most eﬀective feature for SOH estimation, all the possible combinations of the features are investigated and compared. Afterwards, SVM is able to establish the optimal SOH estimator on the basis of the optimal feature combination and the battery SOH. A LiFePO4 battery is tested in the test station for 37 weeks to verify the validation of the proposed method.},

It is based on the impedance analysis and it can be realized by utilizing the dynamic electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (DEIS) technique. Specifically, a sinusoidal current is super­ imposed on the charging current, and the battery impedance is analyzed in the frequency domain without interrupting the charging procedure. In case of lithium plating during charging, the graphite interfacial impedance is significantly decreased and thus, the lithium plating can be detected by monitoring the real and imaginary parts of the battery impedance in real-time. Two battery cell types with different active materials and energy densities are examined at several temperatures and charging currents. The effectiveness of the proposed DEIS technique is validated with the voltage relaxation profile method and in comparison with the current interruption method, for different charging conditions, cell formats and chemistries. The experimental results reveal that the proposed method is capable to effectively detect the lithium plating for rates as high as 6C, at different temperatures and for different battery types.},

	abstract = {The success of electric vehicles depends largely on energy storage systems. Lithium-ion batteries have many important properties to meet a wide range of requirements, especially for the development of electric mobility. However, there are still many issues facing lithium-ion batteries. One of the issues is the deposition of metallic lithium on the anode graphite surface under fast charging or low-temperature conditions. Lithium plating re­ duces the battery life drastically and limits the fast-charging capability. In severe cases, lithium plating forms lithium dendrite, which penetrates the separator and causes internal short. Significant research efforts have been made over the last two decades to understand the lithium plating mechanisms. However, the lithium plating mechanisms have not yet been fully elucidated. Meanwhile, another challenge in the development of fast charging technologies is to identify degradation mechanisms in real-time. This includes real-time detection of lithium plating while the battery is being charged. Accurate detection and prediction of lithium plating are critical for fast charging technologies. Many approaches have been proposed to mitigate lithium plating, such as adopting advanced material components and introducing hybrid and optimized charging protocols. Nevertheless, most detection techniques and mitigation strategies are only used for fundamental research with limited pos­ sibilities in large-scale applications. To date, there is still a lack of a comprehensive review of lithium plating, reflecting state of the art and elucidating potential future research directions. Therefore, in this article, we provide a snapshot of recent advances in lithium plating research in terms of mechanism, detection, and miti­ gation to fill this gap and incentivize more innovative thoughts and techniques. In the present study, the mechanisms of lithium plating and approaches used to characterize and detect it in different applications are carefully reviewed. This review also provides a summary of recent advances in model-based approaches to predict lithium plating. Based on the gathered information, the advantages and drawbacks of each model are compared. The mitigation strategies for suppressing lithium plating at different levels are studied. Finally, we highlighted some of the remaining technical challenges and potential solutions for future advancement.},

This paper focuses on 37Ah commercial lithium-ion batteries and clarifies the evolution of lithium plating during long-term low temperature (− 10 ◦C) cycling. The tested cells are analyzed at different degradation stages, named “fixed-point analysis”, to evaluate the evolution process of lithium plating. It is found that the capacity fade and the internal resistance increase exhibit a decelerated trend with a turning point around 450 cycles. The loss of cyclable lithium caused by lithium plating is deemed to be the main reason behind the battery degradation. Post-mortem analysis including scanning electron microscope (SEM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) is conduced to reveal the mechanism. The thickness and morphology change of plated lithium, and the plated lithium covered by solid electrolyte interface film, are disclosed by the surface and cross-section SEM images from the fixed-point analysis. XPS analysis further reveals the composition of solid electrolyte interface film, and the plated lithium existing. In a nutshell, lithium plating is inhomogeneous and has high spatial dependence.},

In Li-ion cells, reversible heat has a material-dependent characteristic as it is closely related to both entropy change and the temperature dependence of the open circuit voltage. The proposed method measures reversible heat as a highly resolved function of the cell’s state of charge. The determination of reversible heat is based on the evaluation of the temperature difference generated by two current pulses of opposite polarity. Unlike established potentiometric methods, the Double Pulse Method is simple to set up, fast, and cost-effective. The accuracy of the Double Pulse Method is demonstrated for an automotive lithium iron phosphate (LFP) cell, and the entropy changes are compared with measurements of the same cell using the established potentiometric method. Simulation results indicate that the cell temperature is more accurate when determined by the reversible heat measurement obtained by the Double Pulse Method than from the potentiometric method.},

	abstract = {Efficient and accurate management of lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) highly relies on models that capture the in-cell nonlinear behaviors. As one of the most dominant dynamics inside high-energy LIBs, the solid-phase diffusion shows nonlinearity because the lithium diffusivity in solid phase is a physical parameter varying with the lithium concentration. Yet, this nonlinearity has not been well disclosed in the electrical modeling field of LIBs. This paper presents a novel equivalent circuit model in which the effect of nonlinear solidphase diffusion is considered. First, the modeling process is illustrated, and it is worth noting that the circuit representation of solid-phase diffusion is established based on its physical principles at electrode particle level. Second, while paying special attention to the relaxation voltage offset, the model parameters are identified with the help of the multi-timescale characteristics of batteries during the voltage recovery period in pulse discharge test. Finally, the model is thoroughly validated by performing constant-current discharge and dynamic tests on the commercial high-energy LIBs. Results show that the proposed model remains robust to the stateof-health of batteries and outperforms the conventional second-order resistor–capacitor model. Moreover, the model keeps similar simplicity to the conventional one and can meet the real-time requirements in engineering.},

This paper distinguishes the fast and slow change characteristics of the model resistor-capacitor link parameters, a strong applicability model for the aggregate electrical characteristics of vehicle-mounted lithium-ion batteries based on multi-time scales is established. By combining the advantages of different identification algorithms, an adaptive asynchronous parameter identification strategy is proposed, which solves the problem of data saturation caused by the time scale identification strategy. Then, the complex charge-discharge pulse and the mixed discharge pulse tests are designed explicitly, and the parameter results and terminal voltage tracking effects under different identification strategies are compared. Moreover, the consistency results of the parameter identification test under single-time scale forgetting factor recursive least squares and multi-time scale adaptive asynchronous parameter identifi­ cation strategy are analyzed. The results show that under different working conditions, the identification pre­ cision of the terminal voltage based on the adaptive asynchronous parameter identification strategy is increased by 0.420\% and 1.114\% respectively, and the maximum error of parameter consistency is reduced by 158.300\%.},

To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes a novel parameter identification method in which a neural network cooperates with a genetic algorithm. The proposed method adopts an 1-dimensional convolutional neural network to learn the dynamics between the known input current and the corresponding simulated voltage. Although estimated parameters cause large output voltage errors, they are useful for building an electrochemical model and can be used to recommend highly probable parameter candidates. We clearly show through simulation and experiment that the electrochemical model parameters are identified more accurately and reliably compared with various existing results, owing to the high data efficiency of the proposed method.},

	abstract = {Knowing the temperature distribution within a battery pack is vital, because of the impact on capacity loss, power degradation and safety. Temperature measurements are usually realized with temperature sensors attached to a limited number of cells throughout the battery pack, leaving the majority of cells in larger battery systems unattended. This work presents a novel sensorless method for determining the temperature of a cell by exploiting the relation of the cell’s overpotential and temperature exemplary using a 18650 nickel-rich/silicon–graphite cell, although the method is basically applicable to any cell. Current changes in the battery load are utilized as pulse excitation for the calculation of a direct-current resistance ������DC,������������ determined after a certain time ������������. Reference pulses at 10/20/30/40 ◦C are recorded to investigate the influence of state-of-charge and pulse rise/fall-time, as well as the pulse-current amplitude and direction on ������DC,������������. The analysis of the reference pulses shows that a ������������ in the 10 ms to 100 ms regime has the greatest sensitivity to temperature and the least dependence on other parameters. The method is finally validated using a 6s1p-module with an externally constant temperature gradient applied to the serial connection, showing an average estimation error smaller than 1 K for each cell.},

Accurate estimation of SOC is conducive to give full play to the capacity and performance of the battery. For the problems of selection of forgetting factor and poor robustness and susceptibility to the noise of extended Kalman filtering algorithm, this paper proposes a SOC estimation method for the lithium-ion battery based on adaptive extended Kalman filter using improved parameter identification. Firstly, the Thevenin equivalent circuit model is established and the recursive least squares with forgetting factor(FFRLS) method is used to achieve the parameter identification. Secondly, an evaluation factor is defined, and fuzzy control is used to realize the mapping between the evaluation factor and the correction value of forgetting factor, so as to realize the adaptive adjustment of forgetting factor. Finally, the noise adaptive algorithm is introduced into the extended Kalman filtering algorithm(AEKF) to estimate the SOC based on the identification results, which is applied to the parameter identification at the next time and executed circularly, so as to realize the accurate estimation of SOC. The experimental results show that the proposed method has good robustness and estimation accuracy compared with other filtering algorithms under different working conditions, state of health(SOH) and temperature.},

Pulse charging is considered as one of the promising methods for faster and efficient charging. Researchers have proposed pulse charging methods using different pulse frequencies and duty cycles for better performance. However, the effect of pulse charging frequencies on charging time and cycle life is seldom investigated. In this study, rectangular pulse-CV charging experiments on lithium nickel manganese cobalt oxide (NMC) cathode commercial lithium-ion batteries were performed at 50 Hz, 100 Hz, and 1 kHz and compared with benchmark constant current – constant voltage (CC-CV) charging. From the results, it was determined that pulse-CV charging is significantly faster than CC-CV charging. It was also observed that pulse-CV charging at 1 kHz showed comparable discharge capacities to CC-CV charging throughout cycling with an approximate reduction of 17\% in charging time. Battery impedance characteristics were examined using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements, and equivalent circuit pa­ rameters (ECPs) were obtained for analyzing the behavior of the batteries.},

State-of-the art health monitoring methods fall short in terms of their ability to detect early-stage short circuits and in terms of ease of implementation. We report a unique internal-short circuit detection method, capable of detecting early-stage short circuits. A set of electrochemically curated pulse current probes, activated at predetermined states of charge (SOC), accurately determine the short-induced leakage current by comparing with an on-board physics based electrochemical-thermal reduced order model, that considers characteristic nonlinear behaviour of LIBs. These specially designed diagnostic probes act as a ‘treadmill’ test, which detect soft short and estimates the soft short resistance accurately. Importantly, we demonstrate its ability to detect, esti­ mate both internal short and ageing-related battery degradation, even when both are present. Proof-of-concept experiments on commercial batteries show our method’s ability to detect soft short (up to 200Ω) and ageing extents ({\textgreater}90\%) with {\textgreater}98\% accuracy. Anchored in underlying electrochemical processes of the battery, we provide a detailed analysis on how and why this method is uniquely positioned as an accurate, practically implementable health and safety monitoring algorithm on a battery management system.},

A Pseudo-two-Dimensional Lithium-ion battery model is used for Nonlinear Frequency Response Analysis (NFRA). Focus is laid on identiﬁcation of processes in Lithium-ion batteries. The most commonly applied dynamic electrochemical analysis method, Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS), is limited to linear deﬂections of the system. This denotes loss of information about nonlinear system behavior. In contrast, NFRA extends this approach to study the nonlinear behavior of the Lithium-ion battery. We show dependency of nonlinear responses on the input amplitude and several model parameters, such as diffusion coefﬁcient, reaction rate constant and double layer capacitance. Parameter variation demonstrates the capability of this method for process identiﬁcation by investigating the individual higher harmonics and the respective sum. Characteristic peaks can be attributed to electrode reactions and diffusion and frequency regions inﬂuenced by the signal can be identiﬁed. This work gives a deeper understanding of the nonlinear response of a Lithium-ion battery and as such of how to apply this analysis method for Lithium-ion battery state estimation. It is shown that the method NFRA is essential for reliable process identiﬁcation. Battery characterization highly beneﬁts from the combination of EIS and NFRA.},

A good reproducibility of the results has been demonstrated, and V-shape form curves have been obtained with a minimum STD value at about 55 \% of state of charge (SOC).

The complex nature of battery degradation has meant that mechanistic modelling of capacity fade has thus far remained intractable; however, with the advent of cloud-connected devices, data from cells in various applications is becoming increasingly available, and the feasibility of data-driven methods for battery prognostics is increasing. Here we propose Gaussian process (GP) regression for forecasting battery state of health, and highlight various advantages of GPs over other data-driven and mechanistic approaches. GPs are a type of Bayesian nonparametric method, and hence can model complex systems whilst handling uncertainty in a principled manner. Prior information can be exploited by GPs in a variety of ways: explicit mean functions can be used if the functional form of the underlying degradation model is available, and multiple-output GPs can effectively exploit correlations between data from different cells. We demonstrate the predictive capability of GPs for short-term and long-term (remaining useful life) forecasting on a selection of capacity vs. cycle datasets from lithium-ion cells.},

	abstract = {Battery thermal management (BTM) is essential to ensure the safety of the battery pack of electric vehicles. For a variety of BTM technologies, the battery’s internal resistance always plays a critical role in the heat generation rate of the battery. Many factors (temperature, SOC and discharge rate) impact on the internal resistance, however, scant research has explored the effect of battery discharge rate on the internal resistance. This study aims to establish a multi-factor dynamic internal resistance model (MF-DIRM) with error compensation strategy to accurately estimate the internal resistance. In the present study, the internal resistance is estimated using the MF-DIRM which fuses three parameters (the temperature, SOC and discharge rate) and the procedures are two-fold: firstly, the coefficients of the binary fourth-order polynomial about the internal resistance with temperature and SOC are obtained, and then the MF-DIRM is built through the cubic spline interpolation algorithm to interpolate these coefficients at different discharge rates. Rather than measure the internal resistance, this model can estimate the internal resistance, and the estimated error does not exceed 10mΩ. Secondly, to further improve the estimation accuracy of MF-DIRM, the error function of the internal resistance is constructed as a binary cubic spline with the temperature and SOC, thereby constructing a model with error compensation strategy. The MF-DIRM combined with error compensation strategy can better estimate resistance under various conditions and the maximum value of estimation error is less than 2.5 mΩ.},

The capacity deterioration of the commercial cell is mainly caused by the decay of the reversible capacity of LiCoO2 cathode, the irreversible loss of active lithium and the lithium remaining in anode. The proportions of effects by the above three factors are calculated accurately. The consumption of the active lithium leads to a cell imbalance between the anode and the cathode. The electrochemical test results indicate that the capacity fade of the active materials at the low rate is more obvious than that at the high rate. The inﬂuence of the active lithium is gradually increscent with the increasing rate. The rate of 1.5C is the optimal value to accelerate the aging of the full cell by comparing the testing results at different capacity retentions in the speciﬁc condition of low charge/discharge rate and shallow depth of discharge.},

A model-based Bayesian approach is proposed in this paper to predict remaining useful life (RUL) for these types of batteries. First, a two-term logarithmic model is developed to capture the degradation trends of NMC batteries. By ﬁtting the battery degradation data, it is experimentally demonstrated that the developed model is superior to existing empirical battery degradation models. A particle ﬁltering–based prognostic method is then incorporated into the model to estimate the batteries' possible degradation trajectories. Correspondingly, the RUL values of NMC batteries are expressed in terms of probability density function. The effectiveness of the developed method is veriﬁed with our collected experimental data. The results indicate that the proposed prognostic method can achieve higher predictive accuracy than the existing two-term exponential model.},

Especially for promising, relatively novel material combinations, cell-to-cell parameter variations may vary over years, since cell manufacturers might have not yet found the ideal composite to produce cells with high capacity and cycle stability. This study investigates the development of cells’ capacity, internal resistance and energy density over a time span of nearly three years for three different batches of the same cell. The cell under investigation is commercially available and offers a promising material combination of silicon-graphite and nickel-rich NMC. Differential voltage and differential capacity analysis are used to explain possible reasons for cell-to-cell variations. As a result, we found signiﬁcant differences in cell-to-cell variations between the batches. For BEV manufacturers, this means in particular that they should consider how they can counter the inﬂuence of these cell-to-cell variations through an operating strategy in order to protect themselves in the long term against regress claims by customers.},

However, the diﬀerent performances in battery discharge/charge characteristics and working conditions in battery pack make the battery pack SOH estimation diﬃcult. In this paper, the battery pack SOH is deﬁned as the change of battery pack maximum energy storage. It contains all the cells' information including battery capacity, the relationship between state of charge (SOC) and open circuit voltage (OCV), and battery inconsistency. To predict the battery pack SOH, the method of particle swarm optimization-genetic algorithm is applied in battery pack model parameters identiﬁcation. Based on the results, a particle ﬁlter is employed in battery SOC and OCV estimation to avoid the noise inﬂuence occurring in battery terminal voltage measurement and current drift. Moreover, a recursive least square method is used to update cells' capacity. Finally, the proposed method is veriﬁed by the proﬁles of New European Driving Cycle and dynamic test proﬁles. The experimental results indicate that the proposed method can estimate the battery states with high accuracy for actual operation. In addition, the factors aﬀecting the change of SOH is analyzed.},

In this paper, we propose an intelligent SOH estimation framework based on the real-world data of EVs collected by the big data platform. Defined by the more accessible detection, the health features are extracted from historical operating data. Then, the deep learning process is implemented in feedforward neural network driven by the degradation index. The estimation method is validated by the oneyear monitoring dataset from 700 vehicles with different driving mode. The result shows that the proposed framework can effectively estimate SOH with the maximum relative error of 4.5\% and describe the aging trend of battery pack based on big data platform.},

This method allows for the estimation of the degradation of the LIBs during an equivalent duty cycle at various load patterns. The results of many years of research on the degradation of LIBs have been analyzed in two aspects. The first one concerned degradation under constant loads, and the second was related to degradation taking into account randomly variable loads. The conducted analyses demonstrated that the degradation process in the case of LIBs was characterised by high variability depending on the cyclic operation parameters (the charging and discharging half-cycle). Furthermore the degradation of LIBs depends, to a significant extent on the current state of health. For this reason, this parameter was taken into account in the new model, which is an improvement on the currently existing methods. The developed model has been verified by simulating the variable load of the cells during its entire lifespan — the obtained percentage prediction error margin during the whole simulation did not exceed 5\%, which confirmed its practical usefulness.},

	abstract = {The electriﬁcation of passenger cars is one of the most effective approaches to reduce noxious emissions in urban areas and, if the electricity is produced using renewable sources, to mitigate the global warming. This profound change of paradigm in the transport sector requires the use of Li-ion battery packages as energy storage systems to substitute conventional fossil fuels. An automotive battery package is a complex system that has to respect several constraints: high energy and power densities, long calendar and cycle lives, electrical and thermal safety, crash-worthiness, and recyclability. To comply with all these requirements, battery systems integrate a battery management system (BMS) connected to an complex network of electric and thermal sensors. On the other hand, since Li-ion cells can suffer from degradation phenomena with consequent generation of gaseous emissions or determine dimensional changes of the cell packaging, chemical and mechanical sensors should be integrated in modern automotive battery packages to guarantee the safe operation of the system. Mechanical and chemical sensors for automotive batteries require further developments to reach the requested robustness and reliability; in this review, an overview of the current state of art on such sensors will be proposed.},

	abstract = {Nowadays, a large variety of lithium-ion battery (LIB) configurations are being developed in order to meet the specific requirements of different applications, e.g., for battery electric vehicles or stationary energy storage. One characteristic parameter of LIBs is their internal resistance, as it influences the system's power capability and heat generation. However, determining the resistance of a battery pack is not trivial, since it is dependent on many intrinsic and extrinsic influencing factors. In this work, influencing factors on the resistance of 18650 cylindrical cells and large-size prismatic cells are quantified experimentally by means of direct current (DC) pulses and electrochemical impedance spectoscropy (EIS). Furthermore, challenges involved in characterizing the resistance on higher system levels are addressed by investigating battery modules and packs of a research vehicle built out of small cylindrical cells and a series vehicle with large prismatic cell architecture. Finally, based on experimental findings, the authors derive implications for battery modeling that make it feasible to choose the suitable modeling depth and evaluate the numerous different available cell types and system configurations efficiently for their suitability for different battery system concepts. The data for all evaluated resistances is provided as supplementary material [1].},

However, there are still issues, which have to be solved, related to the fast-charging capability of EVs. The pulsed current charging technique is expected to improve the lifetime, charging speed, charging/discharging capacity, and the temperature rising of Li-ion batteries. However, the impact of the pulsed current parameters (i.e., frequency, duty cycle, and magnitude) on characteristics of Li-ion batteries has not been fully understood yet. This paper summarizes the existing pulsed current modes, which are positive Pulsed Current Mode (PPC) and its ﬁve extended modes, and Negative Pulsed Current (NPC) mode and its three extended modes. An overview of the impact of pulsed current techniques on the performance of Li-ion batteries is presented. Then the main impact factors of the PPC strategy and the NPC strategy are analyzed and discussed. The weight of these impact factors on lifetime, charging speed, charging/discharging capacity, and the temperature rising of batteries is presented, which provides guidance to design advanced charging/discharging strategies as well as to determine future research gaps.},

	abstract = {Recently, research on charging strategies for lithium-ion batteries have been widely conducted for fast and safe charging. Among them, pulse charging technology is attracting attention for its effectiveness in terms of suppressing degradation and fast charging. Pulse charging can reduce the polarization voltage by facilitating diffusion of lithium-ions in the electrode by giving a rest time during charging. In this study, by using electro-chemical model of the lithium-ion battery, we analyze the effect of battery degradation according to various pulse parameter and find the optimal pulse parameter in low-temperature and room-temperature environments. Through the model, degradation indicators such as lithium plating and SEI growth were quantitatively analyzed. As a result, when charging with the same average current, it was confirmed that pulse charging caused less degradation and increased temperature compared to the constant-current charging strategy. In pulse charging, the longer the rest time and the smaller the rest current, the greater the degree. Also, it was found that pulse charging is more efficient at low temperature.},

This paper experimentally investigated the effect of the lowfrequency Positive Pulsed Current (PPC) charging on the lifetime and charging performance of Li-ion batteries. A two-stage degradation model of Li-ion batteries is developed to determine the inhibitory effect of the PPC on degradation mechanisms at different aging stages. Moreover, the changes in the Internal Resistance (IR) and the Incremental Capacity (IC) curve are provided to thoroughly explore the effects of the PPC on the degradation of Li-ion batteries. Compared with the traditional Constant Current (CC) charging, the lifetime, maximum rising temperature, and energy efﬁciency of the Li-ion batteries that were cycled by the PPC charging are improved by 81.6\%, 60.5\%, and 9.1\%, respectively, after 1000 cycles. Therefore, low-frequency PPC charging should be considered as a promising charging strategy for Li-ion batteries.},

This paper, taking the positive pulse current mode as an example, comprehensively analyzes the effect of the charging current frequency and the duty cycle on two lifetimerelated parameters, i.e., the capacity fade and internal resistance. Long-term aging experiments are conducted on NMC batteries, and the results demonstrate that all pulse charging strategies with different parameters helps to delay the battery degradation to varying degrees.

	abstract = {The effects of a pulse charging technique on charge–discharge behavior and cycling characteristics of commercial lithium-ion batteries were investigated by comparison with the conventional direct current (dc) charging. The impedance spectra and cycling voltammograms of Li-ion batteries cycled by both protocols have been measured. The individual electrodes in the batteries have also been examined using XRD and SEM. The results show that pulse charging is helpful in eliminating concentration polarization, increasing the power transfer rate, and lowering charge time by removing the need for constant voltage charging in the conventional protocol. Pulse charging interrupts dc charging with short relaxation periods and short discharge pulses during charging, and also improves the active material utilization giving the battery higher discharge capacity and longer cycle life. Impedance measurements show that the magnitude of the interfacial resistance of the batteries cycled both by pulse charging and dc charging is small. However, at the same number of cycles, the interfacial resistance of the pulse charged battery is larger than that of dc charged. The batteries after 300 cycles charged by pulse charging show higher peak currents during both forward and reverse scans indicating higher reversibility of the electrodes. XRD and SEM studies of the individual electrodes indicate that pulse charging maintains the stability of the LiCoO2 cathode better than dc charging and inhibits the increase in the thickness of the passive ﬁlm on the anode during cycling. \# 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

	abstract = {Over the last decade, many efforts have been deployed to develop models for the prediction, the control, the optimization and the parameter estimation of Lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries. It appears that the most successful electrochemical-based model for Li-ion battery is the Pseudo-two-Dimensional model (P2D). Due to the fact that the governing equations are complex, this model cannot be used in real-time applications like Battery Management Systems (BMSs). To remedy the situation, several investigations have been carried out to simplify the P2D model. Mathematical and physical techniques are employed to reduce the order of magnitude of the P2D governing equations. The present paper is a review of the studies on the modeling of Li-ion batteries with simpliﬁed P2D models. The assumptions on which these models rest are stated, the calculation methods are examined, the advantages and the drawbacks of the models are discussed and their applications are presented. Suggestions for overcoming the shortcomings of the models are made. Challenges and future directions in the modeling of Li-ion batteries are also discussed.},

	abstract = {Lithium-ion batteries are considered as promising electric energy storage systems. However, identiﬁcation of battery health is a critical issue. Furthermore, battery aging extremely depends on operating conditions. Therefore, monitoring and analysis of battery health degradation in real-time systems such as electric vehicles, in which a variety of stress factors may come into play, are demanded. This paper proposes a data-driven algorithm based on multiple condition indicator to estimate battery health using application-based load proﬁles. In this regard, battery cells have been cycled under a worldwide light duty driving test cycle (WLTC) load proﬁle in laboratory to acquire real-world driving data. Time-domain and frequency-domain condition indicators are extracted from measured on-board data like voltage and current within certain time intervals, enabling real-time investigation of battery health degradation. The condition indicators have been fed into a Gaussian process estimator to track the real-time state of health (SoH). As degradation strongly depends on magnitude of input current, it is important that the proposed method can predict health of the cell regardless of current amplitude and aging pattern. Therefore, to assess accuracy and robustness of the proposed method, it is validated using a diﬀerent load proﬁle with distinct depth of discharge, current amplitude, and distinctive aging pattern. Results reveal the proposed approach is highly precise and is capable of estimating battery SoH with low computational costs and a relative error of less than 1\%. The proposed technique is promising for online diagnostics of battery health thanks to its high accuracy and robustness.},

	abstract = {Lithium-ion batteries play a major role for the reliability and safety of the energy supply in vehicle power networks. Battery management systems (BMS) are needed to monitor the battery’s inner states, such as state of charge or state of available power. State-of-the-art algorithms running on a BMS cannot fulfill all today’s re­ quirements completely such as qualification for an automotive safety integrity level, implementation on low-cost hardware, adaption to different kinds of aging effects and minimized excitation in a vehicle’s power network. In this paper a new approach for online parameter estimation of a battery model for a lithium-ion battery with titanate oxide anode is presented. The approach combines simple mathematical equations and low memory consumption while still adapting dynamically to different aging effects. In order to handle different types of excitation in the power network, three methods are suggested for analyzing the battery behavior in the time and frequency domain. The algorithms are validated utilizing real driving profiles applied to aged batteries. Therefore, calendric and cyclic battery aging tests were carried out for about two years and up to 100,000 equivalent full cycles. The frequency-based methods are advantageous in terms of impedance parameter tracking while the methods using time-domain parameterization data benefit in terms of time predictions. All proposed methods show promising results regarding voltage predictions independent of the battery’s state of health.},

The frequency resolution was deﬁned by using the standard deviation, and could be controlled by the band parameter fb in CMMW. The large fb level means high frequency resolution and low time resolution. This fact means an uncertainty of resolutions in time and frequency domains. The proposed impedance determination from simple signals like a current step and the voltage response was applied to lithium ion battery (LIB). An impedance spectrum of LIB was determined form the time series data of discharge current and voltage response by the WT.

Unlike the Warburg impedance, the diffusion component has no need for frequency-domain data and is formulated entirely in the time domain. Physical interpretability is validated by comparison with physics-based model (PBM) generated data. Experimental validation is performed at a wide range of state of charge (SoC) and state of health (SoH) using pulse injection and drive cycle data. The mean absolute percent error is below 0.3\% using 5 circuit elements for 4 min of an arbitrary current load.

It is significant to accurately monitor and evaluate the state of charge (SOC) and state of health (SOH) of lithium-ion battery. This paper presents the estimation method of SOC and SOH of lithium-ion battery based on ultrasonic guided wave technology. In the experiment, the guided wave signals are activated by a single fixed piezoelectric transducer and the propagating guided waves are rapidly captured using a scanning laser Doppler vibrometer system. The multi-parameter analysis of the direct wave signals including time-domain, frequency-domain and time-frequency distribution are performed, and thus three guided-wave parameters, namely signal amplitude, time of flight and power spectral density connected with the charge discharge cycle and aging of battery, are successively set to comprehensively evaluate SOC/SOH of lithium-ion battery. The results show that the guided wave parameters in time-domain, frequency-domain and time-frequency distribution have well consistent correspondence with SOC/SOH, and the differential curve analysis of signal amplitude can effectively reflect the phase transitions in the charge-discharge cycle and the aging process. In addition, the sensitivity of ultrasonic guided wave technology to estimation of SOC/SOH gradually decreases with the battery aging.},

An intelligent optimization method named the genetic algorithm-particle swarm optimization algorithm is used to identify the parameters. Based on electrochemical impedance spectroscopy in the frequency domain and the terminal voltage of the dynamic stress test in the time domain, a multi-domain identification method is proposed. In synthetic experiment, the proposed genetic algorithm-particle swarm optimization algorithm has higher ac­ curacy and faster convergence speed than the traditional optimization methods, and the proposed multi-domain identification method has more accurate parameter identification results than the frequency-domain identifi­ cation and time-domain identification. In experiment on lithium-ion batteries, the model parameters are iden­ tified by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and dynamic stress test data, and the parameter identification results are verified by verification test data.

	abstract = {Fractional-order models are gaining increasing relevance in battery modeling in light of the experimental measurements from Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) tests, unequivocally indicating the presence of equivalent circuit components with an impedance of non-integer order. To attain their discrete state-space representation, the approach based on the Grünwald–Letnikov (GL) definition of the fractional derivative has been widely used, albeit its applicability beyond driving cycles remains open to discussion. In this article, we present a novel Dual Fractional-Order Extended Kalman Filter (DFOEKF) for the simultaneous estimation of State of Charge (SOC) and all fractional parameters, based on the multiple-RC approximation instead. We discuss the parameter identification of fractional-order elements on a NMC811/Si-Gr cell from both frequency and time-domain data, highlighting the importance of EIS measurements for the search of appropriate timedomain values. We validate the performance of this method experimentally at different operation stages, as well as its robustness to incorrect initializations, obtaining a SOC root-mean-square (RMS) error of 0.28\% and a voltage RMS error of 15.2 mV in 20 complete charge–discharge cycles. The greatly accurate estimation results both within and outside the driving cycle stage make this method an interesting alternative for the fractional modeling of LIBs in online applications.},

	abstract = {It is crucial to identify the battery's internal short circuit (ISC) for safety. The study aims to explore the effec­ tiveness of ISC detection methods through battery aging. Two types of method are compared in this work: diffusion coefficient calculation based on electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and conventional internal resistance monitoring through algorithms such as recursive least square (RLS). In this work, the frequencydomain P2D model is built to simulate the behavior of the impedance response with different levels of ISC. Then, coin cells are assembled with conductive contaminants to examine the accuracy of the model simulation and the actual influences of the ISC on the impedance. Afterwards, with the proven impedance model and po­ tential influences, the substituted ISC test on commercial 18,650 cells is applied to examine ISC detection based on EIS under different aging statuses. Finally, the conventional internal resistance identification method is used for comparison. The coin cell experimental results in the study indicate that the inception of the ISC mainly alters the low-frequency impedance with much reduced phases, which is also predicted by the model simulation. Similar results with the impacted low-frequency impedance can also be observed in the substituted ISC test for the commercial cells. The diffusion coefficients, the parameter mainly associated with the low-frequency impedance response, increased by 47–143 \% as the battery SOH decreased from 100 \% to 87 \%. In compari­ son, the internal resistance identification method indicates that the ohmic component is relatively stable after the inception of the ISC. The polarization component of the internal resistance exhibits a significant change as high as 234 \%. However, as the battery's SOH decreases, the effectiveness of the polarization resistance fades toward 23 \%.},

	abstract = {Studying the output response of lithium-ion batteries under high-frequency ripple current is important for the cosimulation and optimal design of high-power DC-DC converters using IGBTs. However, this influence has not been sufficiently investigated. In this paper, seven equivalent circuit models which include integer and fractional order models are used to simulate the high frequency characteristics of lithium-ion batteries. Thirteen experi­ ments are designed and implemented on three test platforms, including a self-designed DC-DC platform for triangular wave. These experiments consist of average currents of different amplitudes, ripple currents of different types, amplitudes and frequencies. Unlike previous research, the current excitation and voltage response of high frequency ripple are obtained by separating the short and long time scale signals. The equivalent circuit model components are selected based on the frequency domain characteristics of the impedance spec­ trum. The HMPSO method is employed to implement the parameter identification and simulation analysis of the high frequency model under time domain data. By contrast, the first-order RL model is selected as the preferred choice through modeling and co-simulation. The complexity of the model and co-simulation time is reduced while maintaining voltage accuracy. For the case presented in this paper, the co-simulation time of R(RL) can be reduced by 11.3 \% and 30.2 \% compared to the RL and R(RL)(RL) models.},

	abstract = {Online capacity estimation of lithium-ion batteries plays an important role in battery management systems. Accurate estimation of the current capacity of the battery is helpful for predictive maintenance. Data-driven capacity estimation methods have become increasingly popular in recent years. However, most data-driven approaches assume that the battery degradation data used to train and test obeys the same distribution. In practical applications, there is often a discrepancy in the distributions of the training set and the test set due to differences in the internal chemistry of batteries and various operating conditions. The existing methods for domain adaptive capacity estimation force the global features of the source and target domains to be aligned, but do not take into account the domain-specific information. Thus, models may not extract domain-invariant representation. To address this problem, We propose a feature Disentanglement and tendency Retainment network (DR-Net) for domain adaptive capacity estimation. Specifically, our DR-Net can disentangle the extracted features from raw data into domain-invariant shared features and domain-specific private features while retaining degradation trend information. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves more competitive results in both estimation accuracy and robustness than other state-of-the-art methods.

This paper thoroughly reviews the recent progress on fast charging in terms of material chemistry, thermal issues and charging optimization. Specifically, the microscale mechanisms that limit rate capability are explored and methods for material modification are addressed in detail. To improves the operation safety and battery lifespan at wider temperature ranges, side reactions induced by charging at extreme temperatures are analyzed and solutions are discussed. Preheating at low temperatures is highlighted especially. Furthermore, charging optimization based on local volume expansion, battery model and big data is summarized.

Genetic algorithm (GA) is employed to search for the optimal charging current trajectories. The effects of weighting coefﬁcients of charging time and temperature rise on battery charging performance are discussed. The charging time of the optimized charging protocol is reduced by 50\%, and the associated temperature rise is almost identical, compared to 1/3C constant currentconstant voltage (CC-CV) charging. Aging experiments demonstrate that the proposed charging method has a similar capacity retention ratio to that of 0.5 CC-CV charging after 700 cycles, thereby accomplishing a good balance between charging speed and lifetime.},

	abstract = {Fast charging of lithium-ion batteries is crucial for electric vehicles. As the charge current is a known degradation factor, assessing the impact of fast charging on battery ageing under several operating conditions is necessary to derive usage strategies for system integrators. To bridge existing knowledge gaps, this article reports on a comparative experimental ageing study in fast charging conditions. Three cells, differing in their materials and energy densities, were investigated. The impacts of the following three parameters are compared on these cells: charge current, end-of-charge voltage, and ambient temperature. The results reveal that the impact of fast charging on cycle life strongly depends on battery materials and internal design. The degradation of two of the cells significantly increased when the charge current and voltage increased, whereas that of the third cell was nearly independent of these parameters. While considering thermal conditions, the ageing of each cell was minimised at a different temperature, either cold, moderate, or warm. An analysis of degradation root causes indicates that distinct dominant degradation mechanisms occurred depending on the cell materials. The cells with higher energy density had a lower cycle life (between 100 and 900 cycles) than the most high-power cell (more than 1700 cycles). Experimental results allow the identification of three strategies for reducing charging time while minimising battery degradation. These strategies present several contributions to the design of energy storage systems for electric vehicles, including the choice of a cell, design of thermal management systems, and design of optimised fast charging protocols.},

Cells with a low loading of 1.5 mAh.cmÀ2 withstand XFC performance remarkably well even up to 9C constant current (CC) charging with high charge capacity, high coulombic efﬁciency and very little apparent lithium plating. For a moderate loading of 2.5 mAh.cmÀ2, the 6C CC charge capacity is poor with signiﬁcant amounts of visually observed lithium plating. Simulated electrolyte transport properties are revealed to be insufﬁcient and majorly set limitations for XFC performance in case of the moderate and the only simulated higher loadings ({\textgreater}2.5 mAh.cm-2). Charging at elevated temperature is shown to be an effective strategy for moderate loading cells enabling good 10-min charge capacity, high coulombic efﬁciency, and mitigating lithium plating. Lastly, an electrochemical model is used to investigate strategies for enabling 4e6C CC charging for cells incorporating loading beyond 3 mAh.cmÀ2. As a result, the combination of an increased cell temperature, reduced electrode tortuosity, and enhanced iontransport in the electrolyte are most likely required to facilitate XFC for state of the art and future high energy lithium-ion batteries.},

Li-ion battery systems integrated in the grid will provide much needed ancillary services, such as frequency regulation, peak shaving and load levelling, so that the challenges of future cleaner grids can be properly addressed. Therefore, efforts on all fronts are being made to further reduce the price of operation, materials and production of Li-ion battery systems. In this research, we propose an optimization of the conventional CC-CV charging protocol typically used in Liion batteries. The proposed protocol aims at expanding the lifetime of the system. A reduced-order electrochemical model for a Li-ion cell is used to simulate its dynamic behavior. Additionally, an optimization algorithm is developed and coupled to the dynamic model to obtain optimal chargingdischarging proﬁles that maximizes the cell lifetime. A charging protocol that combines two different charging proﬁles proved to be an easily implementable and effective way of increasing the cell life time by ca. 27\% in these simulations, in comparison to the standard CC-CV protocol.},

While increasing numbers of car manufacturers are introducing electriﬁed models into their offering, range anxiety and the length of time required to recharge the batteries are still a common concern. The high currents needed to accelerate the charging process have been known to reduce energy efﬁciency and cause accelerated capacity and power fade. Fast charging is a multiscale problem, therefore insights from atomic to system level are required to understand and improve fast charging performance. The present paper reviews the literature on the physical phenomena that limit battery charging speeds, the degradation mechanisms that commonly result from charging at high currents, and the approaches that have been proposed to address these issues. Special attention is paid to low temperature charging. Alternative fast charging protocols are presented and critically assessed. Safety implications are explored, including the potential inﬂuence of fast charging on thermal runaway characteristics. Finally, knowledge gaps are identiﬁed and recommendations are made for the direction of future research. The need to develop reliable onboard methods to detect lithium plating and mechanical degradation is highlighted. Robust model-based charging optimisation strategies are identiﬁed as key to enabling fast charging in all conditions. Thermal management strategies to both cool batteries during charging and preheat them in cold weather are acknowledged as critical, with a particular focus on techniques capable of achieving high speeds and good temperature homogeneities.},

First, a single-battery model based on electrothermal aging coupling is proposed; subse­ quently, a battery pack cooling model and battery pack equilibrium management model are combined to form a complete battery pack model that describes the state parameters of the battery pack and the interaction between the individual batteries in the battery pack. Then, a multi-objective optimal charging strategy considering charging time, aging, and energy loss is proposed, and the equilibrium management, temperature, and battery parameters are restricted. A genetic algorithm method was used to optimize the adaptive multi-phase constantcurrent constant-voltage charging strategy. A fast charging strategy based on the shortest charging time is proposed. The results show that the fast charging strategy can significantly reduce charging time but leads to aging and increases energy loss. The contradictory relation between charging time and aging and the interaction between charging time and energy loss are revealed. The balance optimization charging strategy appears on the left side of the Pareto curve. Finally, a balanced charging strategy considering charging time, aging, and energy loss is obtained. In comparison with single batteries with the same average initial current charging, the constant current phase order decreases because of battery pack state parameters and equilibrium management, resulting in different charging strategies.},

Second, an adaptive MCCCV charging strategy involving optimization of the charging current using particle swarm optimization is developed. It can satisfy the preference of users for reducing the charging time or the battery degradation. Finally, three charging strategies based on the Pareto boundary curve of the battery charging timeestate of health are developed: a fast-charging strategy for motorway driving, a minimum-aging charging strategy for family use, and a balanced charging strategy for daily use. Additionally, according to the Pareto boundary, the effects of key factors on the optimization of the charging strategy are analyzed and compared. The results show that the balanced charging strategy is 3.60\% better than the 0.5C constant currenteconstant voltage (CCCV) charging strategy recommended by the battery manufacturer with regard to aging loss. Moreover, the charging time is reduced by 37\%. Compared with the traditional CCCV charging strategy, the proposed adaptive MCCCV charging strategy has good application prospects with regard to both the charging time and the battery degradation.},

	abstract = {Safety issues pertaining to Li-ion batteries justify intensive testing all along their value chain. However, progress in scientiﬁc knowledge regarding lithium based battery failure modes, as well as remarkable technologic breakthroughs in computing science, now allow for development and use of prediction tools to assist designers in developing safer batteries. Subsequently, this paper offers a review of signiﬁcant modeling works performed in the area with a focus on the characterization of the thermal runaway hazard and their relating triggering events. Progress made in models aiming at integrating battery ageing effect and related physics is also discussed, as well as the strong interaction with modeling-focused use of testing, and the main achievements obtained towards marketing safer systems. Current limitations and new challenges or opportunities that are expected to shape future modeling activity are also put in perspective. According to market trends, it is anticipated that safety may still act as a restraint in the search for acceptable compromise with overall performance and cost of lithium-ion based and post lithium-ion rechargeable batteries of the future. In that context, high-throughput prediction tools capable of screening adequate new components properties allowing access to both functional and safety related aspects are highly desirable.},

	abstract = {Urban air mobility (UAM) demands batteries with high energy density, long cycle life, and fast rechargeability. Here, we demonstrate an energy-dense lithium-ion battery (LiB) with ultralong cycle life under ultrafast charging. By using the asymmetric temperature modulation (ATM) method, i.e., charging at an elevated temperature and discharging around the ambient temperature, it is experimentally shown that the 209 Wh/kg LiB is charged to 88\% state of charge (SOC) in {\textasciitilde}5 min under UAM cycling while retaining 97.7\% capacity after 1,000 cycles. Moreover, an experimentally validated electrochemical-thermal (ECT) model is developed to elucidate the fast charging process and the degradation mode of UAM batteries, quantitatively capturing lithium plating during fast charging. We ﬁnd that the LiBs for UAM applications are most prone to lithium plating due to their higher initial SOC required as the reserve for safety; nevertheless, the ATM method is effective in minimizing or preventing lithium plating in the high SOC range of 30-90\%. In addition to slowing down capacity fade, the ATM method also raises the usable capacity by 10\%, which boosts the battery energy density and ensures the battery to perform full UAM cycles even at the end of life.},

	abstract = {The energy industry, transportation and even the smallest consumer electronics beneﬁt from the practical applications of rechargeable batteries. Expectations of battery performance are greatly related to capacity, power output and available lifetime. However, the lifetime is affected by gradual chemical and mechanical degradation of the internal battery structure that cannot easily be predicted prior to installation. The reduction in performance is closely related to a particular usage pattern which is unique to the user and application, and is thus difﬁcult to predict. Reliable real-time prediction of the remaining battery life therefore remains an important research topic. In this paper we show that fading battery performance under cyclic loading can be effectively and continuously followed by introducing the concept of the damage parameter derived from mechanical durability modelling approaches. The damage parameter is calculated continuously by the novel macro-scale hysteresis damage operator model. The hysteresis model is formed by a system of constitutive spring-slider modelling elements, here bridging the complex relation between the battery load and the durability data. The spring and the slider properties are individually calibrated for lithium nickel manganese cobalt oxide (NMC) batteries, however other battery structures can also be used. The durability data is obtained experimentally under controlled steady thermal and cyclic loading (constant charge/discharge current) conditions. The approach is validated on a standardised driving pattern with a complex current history. The predicted battery life is in good agreement with observed repetitions of a simulated load block until 90\% of the initial battery capacity; with 589, 590 and 698 repetitions for the combined test and simulation prediction, full simulation prediction and experiment, respectively. When compared to established equivalent circuit or analytical approaches, the proposed approach requires only a small number of cyclic durability tests with constant current and temperature. In addition, the approach supports the battery design process by allowing simulations for different usage patterns, material and durability data.},

This work aims at the development of a lifetime prediction approach based on an aging model for lithium-ion batteries. A multivariable analysis of a detailed series of accelerated lifetime experiments representing typical operating conditions in hybrid electric vehicle is presented. The impact of temperature and state of charge on impedance rise and capacity loss is quantiﬁed. The investigations are based on a high-power NMC/graphite lithium-ion battery with good cycle lifetime. The resulting mathematical functions are physically motivated by the occurring aging effects and are used for the parameterization of a semi-empirical aging model. An impedance-based electric-thermal model is coupled to the aging model to simulate the dynamic interaction between aging of the battery and the thermal as well as electric behavior. Based on these models different drive cycles and management strategies can be analyzed with regard to their impact on lifetime. It is an important tool for vehicle designers and for the implementation of business models. A key contribution of the paper is the parameterization of the aging model by experimental data, while aging simulation in the literature usually lacks a robust empirical foundation.},

More than a yearlong worldwide harmonized light vehicles (WLTC) cycling corresponds to very accurate root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 0.83\% and 0.78\% at 10 °C and 45 °C temperature, respectively. The model is also able to predict two types of inhouse developed heavy-duty proﬁles with an RMSE of 1.07\% and 0.73\%.

The model is parameterized by 3-electrodetest-cells for the simulation of fast charging profiles by con­ trolling the anodic voltage in order to prevent lithium-plating.

These cells show similar absolute discharge capacity and similar capacity fade about 11 \% within 1000 cycles compared to cells with conventional slow CC-CV charge formations.

However, if pulse current is used to heat a battery, it may lead to significant capacity fading when inappropriate frequency and amplitude values are adopted. Therefore, the pulse pre-heating strategy should be optimized to decrease capacity degradation. This research focuses on the influencing effectiveness of the frequency and amplitude of the required pulse heating current for pre-heating lithium-ion batteries. An electro-thermal model of a lithium-ion battery was established based on its electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) at different temperatures. Based on the proposed model, the maximum permissible amplitudes of the pulse current at different frequencies and different tem­ peratures were obtained to reduce the lithium plating. Also, the optimal strategy was verified using a comparison experiment, where the EIS and the differential voltage were used as indicators. Overall, the results showed that the proposed strategy can heat Li-ion batteries from -20 °C to 5 °C within 308 s, with only a 0.035\% decrease in the capacity after 30 cycles.},

In this context, this paper proposes a novel technique for the SOC estimation based on the unknown input observer and a new differential-algebraic model of a lithium iron phosphate battery. The proposed observer aims to overcome the unknown value of the initial SOC for on-board batteries using only current and terminal voltage measurements. A reduced-order based unknown input observer is developed to estimate the open circuit voltage and the SOC using the OCV-SOC characteristic offlinedetermined. The unbiasedness of the estimation error is guaranteed by the parameterization of a set of Syl­ vester constraints.

	abstract = {Energy security, environmental concerns, and the upgrading of automobile industry are the driving trifecta of the rapid development of electric vehicles (EVs). Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) have become the primary power source for EVs, given their high energy/power density and long service lifetime. However, safety is still a big challenge facing the population of LIBs. Internal short circuit (ISC) is one of the root causes for the failure of LIBs, whereas the mechanism of ISC formation and evolution is still unclear. This paper provides a comprehensive review of formation mechanisms, evolution framework, experimental approaches, detection methods and mitigation strategies of ISC in LIBs. Learning from the typical safety accidents of LIBs, ISC primarily which caused by typical factors is intensively investigated. Later, the behavior and evolution framework of ISC are profoundly elaborated. The ISC experimental approaches are systematically classified into conventional experimental approaches and novel experimental approaches, and their advantages and drawbacks are summarized in detail, respectively. Further, ISC detection methods including offline and online detection methods are comprehensively analyzed. Finally, an insight into the research perspective of ISC mitigation is provided.},

	abstract = {Technical challenges facing the development of battery economic charging for energy management arise from various contradictory objectives, immeasurable internal states, and hard constraints. Available solutions often resort to optimizing economic charging from the perspective of power grid, while few focus on the beneﬁts of electric vehicle (EV) owners. This paper proposes a constrained multi-objective optimization framework to achieve economy-conscious battery charging management. Speciﬁcally, a coupled electrothermal-aging model is ﬁrst applied to capture the nonlinear electrical, thermal, and aging dynamics of a lithium-ion battery with diﬀerent timescales. Then an economic indicator considering the total charging cost caused by both the battery aging and electrical energy loss is formulated, based on a battery resale cost model and the Beijing peak-valley time-of-use (TOU) price. In addition, two crucial but contradictory objectives including the charging time and battery average temperature are also taken into account, along with hard constraints on the battery State of Charge (SOC), charging current, terminal voltage, and temperature. The complicated multi-objective charging problem is solved by using NSGA-II to optimize the multistage constant-current (MCC) proﬁle. Sensitivities of the cut-oﬀ voltage, convection resistance, and ambient temperature are comparatively analysed via Pareto frontier. Numerical results of two extreme cases and several balanced charging cases demonstrate that feasible, economyconscious battery charging management for various user demands can be achieved through suitable equilibrations among charging speed and thermal variations during charging.},

	abstract = {A capacity-based equalization method for active balancing is proposed to increase the usable capacity of aged lithium-ion batteries within a minimum of balancing effort. The main goal of the presented algorithm is to predict the equalization charge for each cell, which is needed to fully charge and discharge every cell of the battery in the next cycle. For this, State-Of-Charge (SOC) and State-Of-Health (SOH) of each cell must be de­ termined. The predicted energy is balanced at the beginning of the cycle and further balancing is performed only if the parameters of the cells change. This ensures that the minimum possible balancing effort is achieved. To validate the performance of the proposed method, a simulation is carried out. For this purpose, a battery model and Battery Management System (BMS) model are built in Matlab/Simulink. The parameters of the simulated cells differ in capacity and initial SOC to imitate an aged battery. The simulation results verify that the developed balancing method can improve the usage of aged batteries compared to conventional methods. This algorithm for active balancing can be used in second life cases of battery systems.},

	abstract = {Efﬁcient fast-charging technology is necessary for the extension of the driving range of electric vehicles. However, lithium-ion cells generate immense heat at high-current charging rates. In order to address this problem, an efﬁcient fast charging–cooling scheduling method is urgently needed. In this study, a liquid cooling-based thermal management system equipped with mini-channels was designed for the fastcharging process of a lithium-ion battery module. A neural network-based regression model was proposed based on 81 sets of experimental data, which consisted of three sub-models and considered three outputs: maximum temperature, temperature standard deviation, and energy consumption. Each submodel had a desirable testing accuracy (99.353\%, 97.332\%, and 98.381\%) after training. The regression model was employed to predict all three outputs among a full dataset, which combined different charging current rates (0.5C, 1C, 1.5C, 2C, and 2.5C) at three different charging stages, and a range of coolant rates (0.0006, 0.0012, and 0.0018 kgÁsÀ1). An optimal charging–cooling schedule was selected from the predicted dataset and was validated by the experiments. The results indicated that the battery module’s state of charge value increased by 0.5 after 15 min, with an energy consumption lower than 0.02 J. The maximum temperature and temperature standard deviation could be controlled within 33.35 and 0.8 °C, respectively. The approach described herein can be used by the electric vehicles industry in real fastcharging conditions. Moreover, optimal fast charging–cooling schedule can be predicted based on the experimental data obtained, that in turn, can signiﬁcantly improve the efﬁciency of the charging process design as well as control energy consumption during cooling.},

	abstract = {To overcome the long-standing challenge of poor performance of large-size automotive lithium-ion battery pack at low temperature, an internal self-heating strategy without lifetime reduction is proposed. A new method superimposing the discharge current on alternating current for self-heating is developed to prevent lithium-ion deposition, which not only avoids the measurement diﬃculty of potential and impedance of anode electrode, but also circumvents inconsistency problem of battery pack. The permissible alternating current and direct current are determined to avoid lithium-ion deposition. An eﬀective yet simple soft-switching circuit is designed for heating of large-size automotive lithium-ion battery pack. The battery pack is warmed up from −20.8 °C to 2.1 °C within 600 s, where the temperature diﬀerence among twelve batteries is below 1.6 °C, implying the essentially uniform temperature distribution. Based on the performance analysis for battery pack, no obvious loss of lithium inventory is found and no lifetime reduction is observed after 600 repeated heating tests due to the suitable over-potential of anode electrode and no substantial thermal-induced aging stress. The proposed self-heating strategy, validated for heating uniformly and eﬀectively without lifetime reduction, is of high potential to deliver a practical solution to poor performance of large-size automotive lithium-ion battery pack in cold conditions.},

The model is developed by integrating the simpliﬁed single particle model (SSPM) and reduced-order model (ROM) to predict solid electrolyte interphase growth (SEI). Results show agreement with the experimental data at 25 °C operating temperature and moderate cycling currents. A maximum error of 3.6\% in ﬁnding the battery discharged Ah is observed in harsh operating conditions, including 60 °C and approaching the end of life of the battery. Due to the typical operating conditions of stand-alone renewable energy systems, more accurate estimations are expected. Finally, this methodology is utilized to predict the lifetime of lithium-ion batteries that are combined with PV generators to supply electricity to an isolated house situated near Zaragoza, Spain, under two control strategies. The results indicate realistic lifetime predictions when using the model in real operating conditions for this kind of system. Besides, by maintaining the batteries in states of charge of lower than 70\%, around 55\% increase in the battery lifetime can be achieved at the cost of 0.23\% reduction in the percentage of the electrical load that is able to be covered by the stand-alone system.},

The optimization aims at prolonging battery lifetime while not restricting the driver in their driving and usage behavior. This framework is based on accelerated aging tests of LMO cells as well as approximated battery aging and E2W powertrain models. Latter are applied to a typical driving profile of Shanghai. Central aim of the proposed framework is to identify relevant cycles and to optimize charging profiles under consideration of SOC constraints in order to extend battery lifetime. Both factors, targeted SOC and charging profiles, are known to have a significant impact on aging. Results are presented for different lengths of the driving cycle, initial SOCs, and temperatures and a heuristic charging rule is derived. One optimization scenario is validated by applying the optimal charging profile to typical cells used for E2W and by exploiting the targeted SOC as additional degree of freedom. The results are compared to a conventional strategy. Lifetime predictions expect a lifetime prolongation of half a year.},

Open-circuit potential, infrared thermography and calorimetry experiments of a high-energy 18650 NMC-811/SiC lithium-ion cell are used for model parameterization and validation. First, a single p2D model is used to compare the charging rate capabilities of NMC-811/SiC and NMC-111/graphite cells. We assess the modeling error of the single p2D model relative to the multi-dimensional model as a function of tab design. The multi-dimensional model is then used to study different tab and electrode designs regarding their susceptibility to lithium plating, which is evaluated based on local anode overpotential and local temperature. High-rate charging current profiles that minimize the risk of lithium plating are derived by implementing an anode potential threshold. We show that a state of charge beyond 60\% can be reached in less than 18 min.},

	abstract = {Distribution-based analyses, such as the distribution of relaxation times (DRT) and the distribution of diffusion times (DDT), present model-free alternatives to equivalent circuit modeling for analysis of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) data. However, reconstructing such distributions from noisy impedance data is an ill-posed problem that must be solved with specialized inversion algorithms, requiring careful control and tuning. Furthermore, most inversion algorithms developed to date can only solve problems of limited complexity. In this work, we present a new hierarchical Bayesian method for EIS inversion, leveraging efficient algorithms for optimization and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) sampling to solve models of arbitrary complexity. We overcome the challenge of ad-hoc parameter tuning by encoding intrinsic characteristics of the DRT and DDT into flexible prior distributions and “pre-calibrating” the model to simulated data. This approach is versatile, highly robust to noise, and provides quantitative estimates of both the error structure of the data and the uncertainty in the recovered distributions. The model is validated with simulated data to demonstrate accurate recovery of the DRT and the DDT. The method also shows promise for simultaneous recovery of multiple distributions, raising the intriguing possibility of semi-autonomous EIS analysis and ad-hoc model construction. Finally, the practical utility of the method is illustrated with experimental data. Throughout, we draw comparisons to several recently published EIS inversion methodologies.},

	abstract = {For electric vehicles (EVs) and hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs), the accurate estimation of state of charge (SoC) has always been the focus of research. The commonly used SoC estimation methods are based on equivalent circuit model (ECM) and require high model accuracy. With battery aging, its impedance and capacity will change, which inevitably affects the estimation accuracy. In this paper, the impedance spectrum detection method is integrated into the battery management system (BMS), and a new model updating strategy based on electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is proposed for SoC algorithm. Firstly, the evolution of impedance spectrum with battery aging is analyzed through accelerated aging test. It is found that the aging mainly causes the increase of ohmic resistance for the tested Li-ion battery but has no significant impact on the charge transfer and diffusion processes. Therefore, the model parameters and capacity are modified according to the change rate of ohmic impedance. Secondly, the proposed method is verified under charging and discharging conditions. Results show that as the battery ages, the SoC estimation value will be lower than the real value under the discharging condition and higher than the real value under the charging condition. Meanwhile, the maximum absolute error (MaxAE) will reach 29.9 \% after 1000 cycles. In contrast, based on EIS correction, the MaxAE can be controlled within 5.4 \%, which effectively enhances the estimation accuracy.},

The program now incorporates new variable weighting choices which can greatly minimize such bias.

The use of this multisine excitation signal decreases the measurement time. Moreover, it allows to perform a rigourous data-analysis and to quantify the signal-to-noise ratio, the level of non-linear and non-stationary behaviour. It was shown that by using this technique the optimal measurement conditions can be chosen based on a trade-off between signalto-noise ratio and non-linear behaviour. Moreover, in the modeling procedure the noise, non-linearities or non-stationarities can be taken into account.

	abstract = {Electrical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) can be used to characterize biological materials in applications ranging from cell culture to body composition, including tissue and organ state. The emergence of cell therapy and tissue engineering opens up a new and promising ﬁeld of application. While in most cases classical measurement techniques based on a frequency sweep can be used, EIS based on broadband excitations enables dynamic biological systems to be characterized when the measuring time and injected energy are a constraint. Myocardial regeneration, cell characterization in micro-ﬂuidic systems and dynamic electrical impedance tomography are all examples of such applications. The weakness of such types of fast EIS measuring techniques resides in their intrinsic loss of accuracy. However, since most of the practical applications have no restriction over the excitation used, the input power spectrum can be appropriately designed to maximize the accuracy obtained from the measurements. This paper deals with the problem of designing the optimal multisine excitation for electrical bioimpedance measurements. The optimal multisine is obtained by the minimization of the Cramer–Rao lower bound, or what is the same, by maximizing the accuracy obtained from the measurements. Furthermore, because no analytical solution exists for global optimization involving time and frequency domains jointly, this paper presents the multisine optimization approach partially in both domains and then combines the results. As regards the frequency domain approach, a novel contribution is made for the multisine amplitude power spectrum. In the time domain, multisine is optimized by reducing its crest factor. Moreover, the impact on the information and accuracy of the impedance spectrum obtained from using different multisine amplitude power spectra is discussed, as well as the number of frequencies and frequency distributions. The theory is supported by a set of validation measurements when exciting with the optimal and ﬂat multisine signals and compared to a single frequency ac impedance analyzer when characterizing an RC circuit. In vivo healthy myocardium tissue electrical impedance measurements show that broadband EIS based on multisine excitations enable the characterization of dynamic biological systems.},

	abstract = {The early detection of micro internal short circuit (ISCr) cells can provide suﬃcient response time for preventing accidents such as spontaneous thermal runaway in battery packs of electric vehicles, and greatly improve safety. Because the existing models describing ISCr are mainly equivalent circuit models and three-dimensional physicsbased models, we build a pseudo-two-dimensional model of micro ISCr cells to make up for the gaps. Using the calculation results of this model, we reveal the phenomenon of electric quantity depletion and the variation of internal electrochemical parameters when a micro ISCr occurs in the cell. We ﬁnd the eﬀective electrical conductivity of the separator is a crucial parameter describing the ISCr severity and determine reasonable values for this eﬀective conductivity for fault diagnosis and battery design. Moreover, we propose an impedance-identiﬁcation method that can be used for ISCr diagnostics. Through the simulation and experimental results, we ﬁnd that the impedance of micro ISCr cells is diﬀerent from that of normal cells and shows a certain regularity with the increase of ISCr severity.},

Though his­ torically it has been applied almost exclusively to crevice and pitting corrosion studies, application to batteries is interesting for basic science and shows a huge potential for non-perturbing real-time sensor development. Given this promise, noise studies on batteries are starting to appear in the literature. In this manuscript, we are going to critically evaluate the small but emerging body of literature and investigate the mathematical methods employed. We will discuss the intricacies of electrochemical noise applied to batteries both in measurements and in analysis in order to initiate a deeper discussion. In conclusion, we argue that reliance on mathematical methods alone is not the answer, as all mathematical methods use require parameters to guide the analysis. Instead, post-mortem characterizations of batteries can guide the understanding of noise signals measured in batteries, guiding potential mathematical analysis methods and their steps.},

Here, we study the degradation behavior of a high-entropy oxyﬂuoride cathode material in lithium cells in situ via acoustic emission (AE) monitoring. The AE signals allow acoustic events to be correlated with different processes occurring during battery operation. The initial cycle proved to be the most acoustically active due to signiﬁcant chemo-mechanical degradation and gas evolution, depending on the voltage window. Irrespective of the cutoff voltage on charge, the formation and propagation of cracks in the electrode was found to be the primary source of acoustic activity. Taken together, the ﬁndings help advance our understanding of the conditions that affect the cycling performance and provide a foundation for future investigations on the topic.},

Acoustic emission (AE) can perform dynamic non-destructive testing of lithium-ion batteries under nor­ mal charge-discharge cycles, and detect the deformation of internal electrodes of the battery behavior. In this paper, firstly, the whole aging process of lithium-ion batteries and recorded AE signals are monitored. Secondly, the waveform and signal time interval from AE signals during battery aging in the time domain is extracted. Thirdly, the spectrum of AE signals is analyzed. The experimental results show that the total number of AE signals will change with the decline of battery capacity and SOH. The turning point in the time interval waveform of the battery AE signal can be used to identify the constant current or voltage charging mode. The AE signals of batteries mainly exist in two frequency bands, where the content of frequency band 1 is about 10kHz-120kHz, and the range of frequency band 2 is about 130kHz-180kHz. The maximum ampli­ tude of frequency bands 1 and 2 shows their characteristics during the charging and discharging process.},

The interest of ENA relates with the possibility of in-situ diagnostics during charging or discharging of the battery. Thus, the extraction of small voltage fluctuations should take into account the time evolution of the mean signal. The non-stationary character of the phenomenon (charging and discharging battery) limits the use of traditional methods of signal filtering and attenuation, so a special methodology has been developed to calculate the noise standard deviation (STD). A good reproducibility of the results has been demonstrated, and V-shape form curves have been obtained with a minimum STD value at about 55 \% of state of charge (SOC). It can be noted also that fast discharge provided with 3.3 Ω load is noisier than the slow one with 5 Ω load. Some promising results have been obtained regarding the possibility of battery state of health determination.},

Because high-entropy oxides constitute a new class of electrode materials, systematic understanding of their behavior during ion insertion and extraction is yet to be established. Here, we probe the conversion-type HEO material in lithium half-cells by acoustic emission (AE) monitoring. Especially the clustering of AE signals allows for correlations of acoustic events with various processes. The initial cycle was found to be the most acoustically active because of solid-electrolyte interphase formation and chemo-mechanical degradation. In the subsequent cycles, AE was mainly detected during delithiation, a finding we attribute to the progressive crack formation and propagation. Overall, the data confirm that the AE technology as a non-destructive

	abstract = {Battery management system (BMS) is an integral part of the Lithium-ion battery (LIB) for safe operation and power management. The advanced BMSs also provide state of charge (SOC) and state of health (SOH) information. Accurate estimation of the SOC and SOH from a sparse set of input and output measurements (voltage, current, and surface temperature) is challenging due to the internal inter-related complex electrochemical side reactions. Several factors, such as charge/discharge rate, operating temperature, internal aging, abnormal charging-discharging cycles, and internal faults, adversely affect the LIB's health. To aid the development of intelligent and robust BMS with the capability of health-conscious decision making, a deep understanding of the internal degradation mechanisms and the effect of external degradation-inducing factors are of primary importance. This paper presents an in-depth review of internal and external degradation mechanisms at both anode and cathode of LIB with their corresponding mathematical models and correlation with SOH metrics (capacity and power fade). Different electrochemical models integrated with the internal degradation mechanisms and their governing equations are discussed and summarized. The effects of the external aging factors on capacity and power fade and the dominant degradation mechanism under cycling and stored conditions are also reviewed and tabulated for quick reference. Recent developments in BMS's capabilities for SOH estimation using advanced and intelligent algorithms under various internal degradation conditions are also presented. Finally, the challenges in modeling, estimation of SOH, and several future research directions for developing self-learning and smart BMS are provided.},

Thus, the battery modules have to be tested and sorted according to their state of health before being assembled in battery packs and used in their second-life application. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy is a powerful and effective tool for characterization of batteries state of health. Due to the need of fast testing and the tendency to perform the EIS measurements on module level, it is meaningful to assess the validity of EIS on module level and if the SOH can be retrieved in the same way as for individual cells. In this paper, EIS is performed on a lithium-ion battery module with an unknown history and state of health. Curve fitting technique was used to fit the measured EIS spectra to an equivalent circuit model (ECM) to extract the circuit elements. The contribution of individual cell elements to the whole module elements was investigated and the elements sensitive to SOH were determined. The charge transfer resistance, double layer capacitance and the ohmic resistance of the individual cells were accurately reflected on the module’s ECM elements. The ohmic resistance and the charge transfer resistance showed correlation to the SOH of the cells and the module.},
